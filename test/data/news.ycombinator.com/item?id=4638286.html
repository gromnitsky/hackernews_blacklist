What more do you require to understand the situation?<p>I mean, if the CEO told everyone up front about the tactics he was going to use to allow him to cash out early that also prevented everyone else from doing the same at the same time and also that the future of the company was all downhill; then maybe you have a point.<p>Maybe saying they were cheated is a better phrase for you?<p>If you don't agree that that's fine.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I think you're ignoring the role of psychology. I think you do this very explicitly in your first comment:<p>&#62;<i>some Silicon Valley developers, one of the highest paid professions in one of the highest paid areas of the world, only made a decent salary instead of a fantastic total compensation package?</i><p>The relevance of the integrity of the managers to the ways people make decisions that determine the course of their lives is not something to be taken lightly. This applies even if the consequences themselves do not appear to be so dire. There is a distinctly painful feeling that comes along with devoting your life to someone who abuses that. For those familiar with this perception, the idea that you could ignore it is preposterous. From your perspective, whatever it may be, it could beyond your imagination and experience.<p>You might say this:<p>&#62;<i>Is it really 'heartbreaking' when someone's 17-year-old cat dies? It's a normal and expected outcome; plus, not only were they lucky enough to afford a pet and keep it in good health, the animal itself hasn't lost much, considering it's limited cognitive capacity.</i><p>And yet anyone who has been through or even near this situation would find the argument to be incredibly callous, because the formation of human emotion has so much more to it than simply evaluating one's present situation.<p>I understand the sentiment that perhaps nobody is entitled to a fantastically large amount of money and that people living what we call the good life are a small minority in the world. However, that just isn't the story here.<p>Connections between humans are what make society possible. It's reasonable to care when they are abused.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=4639206&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%38%32%38%36">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="../ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=280></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_4639403 href="http://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4639403&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%38%32%38%36"><img src="../ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_4639403></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=reitzensteinm">reitzensteinm</a> 4 days ago  | <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4639403">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I don't know, I kind of read your comment to say that unless you're dying some horrible death you shouldn't be using the word "heartbreaking" to describe the plight of someone. I think it would be heartbreaking for someone to toil away their time with family and friends in the hopes of a payout only to have it blow up in their face. Relationships do die and health does suffer from the strain of some peoples endeavors. While you can say that these programmers and artists brought it upon themselves and took on that challenge, at the same time there is enormous pressure by employers and the culture itself which reinforces the notion of grinding away and sometimes poor work/life balances.<p>I think it's very hard to define exactly where your slippery slope of perspective begins and ends.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I was going to comment on reitz' original statement because something was off in the way it was put.<p>I didn't because every time I went over it and sliced it, there was too much scope to misunderstand what was said.<p>But there were 2 aspects that I knew were triggers -<p>1) His underlying assumption that the employees were there for playing the "startup lottery". Firstly this ascribes knowledge of the mind set of the emps. Secondly this ignores the fact that Zynga also was a "safer" firm given its history and at the time, certain prospects.<p>The employees for that firm which are hurting today aren't necessarily the same as your first batch or second batch hires in an untested startup.<p>(this is why I didn't comment - there are many ways to slice and dice this further, and suffer from badly drawn edges and subsets)<p>2) His description of it as startup lottery. The underlying philosophy here on HN, and in most places which discuss startups is strongly merit oriented.
His statement carried the implication that all the discussions so far were eye wash - it was a lottery and people lost, bad luck.<p>His later clarifications were pretty crucial to explain his context, but I can completely see where he ticked people off.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=4639798&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%38%32%38%36">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="../ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=200></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_4639099 href="http://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4639099&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%38%32%38%36"><img src="../ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_4639099></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=stfu">stfu</a> 4 days ago  | <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4639099">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>People like that have lawyers on retainer.  And if those same lawyers did their job when the options contracts were written, the lawsuits won't amount to anything.<p>This is a pretty common story.  Probably more common than when the options pay anything.  I once worked for a company that acquired another company.  We were bigger, our CEO set up the deal, their CEO got paid, etc.  But officially it was a "merger of equals".  Why?  Because if we'd bought them their options would have vested immediately and we would have had to buy up all the stock the employees held.<p>The way it was worked my company traded their options for options in the new company.  Two years later everyone who had worked for the company we acquired was out of a job, and they had to decide whether or not to exercise their options in a company that wasn't publicly traded (which is madness, BTW - never, ever do that).  I would have bought one of those mirrors on a stick and checked under my car every day if I'd been the CEO.  But eventually he cashed out for a cool $15m.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=4639774&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%38%32%38%36">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="../ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=240></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_4639052 href="http://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4639052&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%38%32%38%36"><img src="../ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_4639052></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=malandrew">malandrew</a> 4 days ago  | <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4639052">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>&#62; I had to buy out my options and it came with a large tax bill for some reason<p>This usually happens if your option has a strike price lower than the market price at the time they're issued, in which case depending on jurisdiction they difference will usually be taxed as income on exercise. If you're really unlucky about where you are and how the options are arranged, you might even get taxed based on the market price on <i>exercise</i>. E.g. Norway at least used to be that way a while back unless you took specific precautions to get the options issued under an approved scheme.<p>It's something to be aware of, as it means a lot of people might not be able to afford to exercise the options before they're ready to sell the shares, which means your total gains gets taxed as income most places (as opposed to if you see the company on a nice upwards trajectory and exercise and wait, in which case you may end up paying only capital gains and in some cases depending on where you are might end up paying reduced capital gains rates on the growth from your exercised onwards). The difference between a good and bad options plan can easily be 50%+ tax (e.g. UK, if you're careless you might pay 53.8% - top rate income tax + national insurance + employers national insurance contributions, vs. 10% if your company qualifies for certain incentive schemes for startups and the options plan is structured right..)<p>It might seem great to have a really low strike price, but if you expect to be in it for the long haul and might contemplate exercising options before you're ready to sell your shares, talk to a tax lawyer before agreeing to options terms.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=4639963&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%38%32%38%36">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="../ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=320></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_4640291 href="http://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4640291&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%38%32%38%36"><img src="../ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_4640291></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=alexkus">alexkus</a> 3 days ago  | <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4640291">link</a></span></div><br>

Is it like <i>"First perform at the Opera House and then we'll talk Mozart"</i>?<p>Most of the times <i>they do not have same desires</i>. For whatever reasons. Be it the immediate need to support family or the ambition the fire of desire having been lost over the years or fight and struggle to look for a stable mean to live. Or maybe the kind of education/upbringing he received. Or the company he grew up with (well, this is very important). This is also has a lot to do with the genes you were born with.<p>This is the nature of a capitalist society and other ones are even worse. In a capitalist people are supposed to be of uneven means so they are. In a society like communist societies people are not supposed to be of uneven means (in the usual sense) and still they are and the gap is a lot wider than that in the former society.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=4639352&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%38%32%38%36">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="../ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=280></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_4640183 href="http://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4640183&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%38%32%38%36"><img src="../ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_4640183></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=galactus">galactus</a> 3 days ago  | <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4640183">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000><i>Sigh</i>.<p>The place I lived in Mountain View was prime real estate.  I was <i>on</i> Castro street, one of the only walkable places outside of San Francisco proper.  There is plenty of cheaper real estate in MV.<p>Similarly in Battersea I live near Clapham Junction.  I can get to Heathrow in 40, Gatwick in 30, Soho in 25 and Bright on 50!  I can also cycle to Trafalgar Sq in 20 mins if the lights are favorable.  <i>Again</i>, there are cheaper places around, but not without worse location or other problems with the property.<p>Also, the first property on the link you listed is £390 a week.  You do realize that that is $2700 / month right?  And you do realize that in Mountain View when you rent there is no council tax, and you don't pay estate agents any fees at all.   In fact there are no estate agents, and property holders often give you some kind of deal like reduced rent for the first month to get you to sign a lease.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=4644179&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%38%32%38%36">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="../ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=160></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_4638856 href="http://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4638856&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%38%32%38%36"><img src="../ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_4638856></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=samstave">samstave</a> 4 days ago  | <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4638856">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>&#62; Is it really heartbreaking that some Silicon Valley developers, one of the highest paid professions in one of the highest paid areas of the world, only made a decent salary instead of a fantastic total compensation package?<p>They effectively worked two full-time jobs for a year and a half, and got paid for one.  Average salary for a programmer at Zynga seems to be around $100k, which is less than I make working 37.5 hour weeks, not 100-hour ones.<p>So, <i>yes</i>.  It's pretty heartbreaking to see them get fucked over after giving their entire life to Zynga for the better part of 2 years.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I'm curious. It's been a long time since I visited San Francisco, so maybe things have massively changed, but I recall that it used to have things like coffee shops, restaurants, fast food places, bookstores, groceries, movie theaters, and all the other kinds of things you'll find in pretty much any city in the US.<p>These places employed baristas, waiters, bus boys, burger flippers, sales clerks, stock boys, and such. Such people typically work fixed shifts, and so unlike many developers have time to find people to start families with and have children.<p>Based on some of the comments here, it would seem that getting by on just a developer's salary in San Francisco is near impossible--you have to have stock money to keep you afloat.<p>So how come waiters, sales clerks, etc., can work in San Francisco and make ends meet for not only themselves for for a family, but single developers making more than the combined income of that entire working class family cannot? One comment mentioned that the developers might have student loans to pay off, but that's countered by the working class family might have to pay a lot to add their kids to their health insurance.<p>Same question for New York, and any other place where people consider $100k/year too low to be a living wage for a programmer.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=4639071&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%38%32%38%36">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="../ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_4639110 href="http://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4639110&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%38%32%38%36"><img src="../ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_4639110></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=doomlaser">doomlaser</a> 4 days ago  | <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4639110">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>When your income increases your spending increases, more like you get tempted to spend money buying things and that temptation then turns in an habit. Then what happens is law of diminishing utility kicks in. You just get used to things and it becomes a norm in your life.<p>After this if your income tanks, it hurts hard.<p>You can very well travel by bus for 20 years of your life, travel a day by car and it will make you feel awesome. Then travel 10 years by car, it just feels normal. Then when you go through a difficult financial, which forces you to take a bus again- This time you will feel like crap.<p>People whom you are talking about are addicted to changing phones/tablets twice an year. Buying developer toys because they like it, drink latte every 45 mins just because they can. I can go on and on, but if you sit down and jolt down list of things that we do and spend money on, you will realize <i>We are basically addicted to spending money</i><p>We just keep buying things. We are told to not do so means not doing better compared to your peers. We are told living frugal means living like a loser and spending money on fun/experiences/&#60;whatever you call it&#62; is what makes you successful.<p>Net-Net you end spending a lot more on things you don't at all. And expenses go up real high.<p>I've seen this among my rich friends as a kid, mysteriously they couldn't even live without things which I didn't even know about.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=4639996&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%38%32%38%36">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="../ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_4640431 href="http://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4640431&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%38%32%38%36"><img src="../ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_4640431></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=theorique">theorique</a> 3 days ago  | <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4640431">link</a></span></div><br>
