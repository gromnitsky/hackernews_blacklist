<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I think you're ignoring the role of psychology. I think you do this very explicitly in your first comment:<p>&#62;<i>some Silicon Valley developers, one of the highest paid professions in one of the highest paid areas of the world, only made a decent salary instead of a fantastic total compensation package?</i><p>The relevance of the integrity of the managers to the ways people make decisions that determine the course of their lives is not something to be taken lightly. This applies even if the consequences themselves do not appear to be so dire. There is a distinctly painful feeling that comes along with devoting your life to someone who abuses that. For those familiar with this perception, the idea that you could ignore it is preposterous. From your perspective, whatever it may be, it could beyond your imagination and experience.<p>You might say this:<p>&#62;<i>Is it really 'heartbreaking' when someone's 17-year-old cat dies? It's a normal and expected outcome; plus, not only were they lucky enough to afford a pet and keep it in good health, the animal itself hasn't lost much, considering it's limited cognitive capacity.</i><p>And yet anyone who has been through or even near this situation would find the argument to be incredibly callous, because the formation of human emotion has so much more to it than simply evaluating one's present situation.<p>I understand the sentiment that perhaps nobody is entitled to a fantastically large amount of money and that people living what we call the good life are a small minority in the world. However, that just isn't the story here.<p>Connections between humans are what make society possible. It's reasonable to care when they are abused.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=4639206&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%38%32%38%36">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="../ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=280></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_4639403 href="http://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4639403&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%38%32%38%36"><img src="../ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_4639403></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=reitzensteinm">reitzensteinm</a> 7 hours ago  | <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4639403">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>The comment you quote was trying to point out that they will recover from this, and have a fantastic career ahead of them.<p>It was not meant to be a comment on how it feels <i>today</i>, or to suggest that we shouldn't feel empathy for them because of their future position.<p>I just meant that in a few years they'll look back on this and laugh, which makes it story <i>much</i> less sad.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I don't know, I kind of read your comment to say that unless you're dying some horrible death you shouldn't be using the word "heartbreaking" to describe the plight of someone. I think it would be heartbreaking for someone to toil away their time with family and friends in the hopes of a payout only to have it blow up in their face. Relationships do die and health does suffer from the strain of some peoples endeavors. While you can say that these programmers and artists brought it upon themselves and took on that challenge, at the same time there is enormous pressure by employers and the culture itself which reinforces the notion of grinding away and sometimes poor work/life balances.<p>I think it's very hard to define exactly where your slippery slope of perspective begins and ends. Bottom line is that greater injustice is never an excuse for injustice. Neither are acceptable.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=4639196&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%38%32%38%36">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="../ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=240></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_4639854 href="http://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4639854&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%38%32%38%36"><img src="../ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_4639854></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=arvinjoar">arvinjoar</a> 4 hours ago  | <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4639854">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I was going to comment on reitz' original statement because something was off in the way it was put.<p>I didn't because every time I went over it and sliced it, there was too much scope to misunderstand what was said.<p>But there were 2 aspects that I knew were triggers -<p>1) His underlying assumption that the employees were there for playing the "startup lottery". Firstly this ascribes knowledge of the mind set of the emps. Secondly this ignores the fact that Zynga also was a "safer" firm given its history and at the time, certain prospects.<p>The employees for that firm which are hurting today aren't necessarily the same as your first batch or second batch hires in an untested startup.<p>(this is why I didn't comment - there are many ways to slice and dice this further, and suffer from badly drawn edges and subsets)<p>2) His description of it as startup lottery. The underlying philosophy here on HN, and in most places which discuss startups is strongly merit oriented.
His statement carried the implication that all the discussions so far were eye wash - it was a lottery and people lost, bad luck.<p>His later clarifications were pretty crucial to explain his context, but I can completely see where he ticked people off.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=4639798&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%38%32%38%36">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="../ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=200></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_4639088 href="http://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4639088&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%38%32%38%36"><img src="../ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_4639088></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ma2rten">ma2rten</a> 9 hours ago  | <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4639088">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>People like that have lawyers on retainer.  And if those same lawyers did their job when the options contracts were written, the lawsuits won't amount to anything.<p>This is a pretty common story.  Probably more common than when the options pay anything.  I once worked for a company that acquired another company.  We were bigger, our CEO set up the deal, their CEO got paid, etc.  But officially it was a "merger of equals".  Why?  Because if we'd bought them their options would have vested immediately and we would have had to buy up all the stock the employees held.<p>The way it was worked my company traded their options for options in the new company.  Two years later everyone who had worked for the company we acquired was out of a job, and they had to decide whether or not to exercise their options in a company that wasn't publicly traded (which is madness, BTW - never, ever do that).  I would have bought one of those mirrors on a stick and checked under my car every day if I'd been the CEO.  But eventually he cashed out for a cool $15m.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=4639774&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%38%32%38%36">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="../ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=240></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_4639052 href="http://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4639052&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%38%32%38%36"><img src="../ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_4639052></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=malandrew">malandrew</a> 9 hours ago  | <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4639052">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>&#62; I had to buy out my options and it came with a large tax bill for some reason<p>This usually happens if your option has a strike price lower than the market price at the time they're issued, in which case depending on jurisdiction they difference will usually be taxed as income on exercise. If you're really unlucky about where you are and how the options are arranged, you might even get taxed based on the market price on <i>exercise</i>. E.g. Norway at least used to be that way a while back unless you took specific precautions to get the options issued under an approved scheme.<p>It's something to be aware of, as it means a lot of people might not be able to afford to exercise the options before they're ready to sell the shares, which means your total gains gets taxed as income most places (as opposed to if you see the company on a nice upwards trajectory and exercise and wait, in which case you may end up paying only capital gains and in some cases depending on where you are might end up paying reduced capital gains rates on the growth from your exercised onwards). The difference between a good and bad options plan can easily be 50%+ tax (e.g. UK, if you're careless you might pay 53.8% - top rate income tax + national insurance + employers national insurance contributions, vs. 10% if your company qualifies for certain incentive schemes for startups and the options plan is structured right..)<p>It might seem great to have a really low strike price, but if you expect to be in it for the long haul and might contemplate exercising options before you're ready to sell your shares, talk to a tax lawyer before agreeing to options terms.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=4639963&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%38%32%38%36">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="../ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=320></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_4640291 href="http://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4640291&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%38%32%38%36"><img src="../ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_4640291></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=alexkus">alexkus</a> 35 minutes ago  | <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4640291">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I'm curious. It's been a long time since I visited San Francisco, so maybe things have massively changed, but I recall that it used to have things like coffee shops, restaurants, fast food places, bookstores, groceries, movie theaters, and all the other kinds of things you'll find in pretty much any city in the US.<p>These places employed baristas, waiters, bus boys, burger flippers, sales clerks, stock boys, and such. Such people typically work fixed shifts, and so unlike many developers have time to find people to start families with and have children.<p>Based on some of the comments here, it would seem that getting by on just a developer's salary in San Francisco is near impossible--you have to have stock money to keep you afloat.<p>So how come waiters, sales clerks, etc., can work in San Francisco and make ends meet for not only themselves for for a family, but single developers making more than the combined income of that entire working class family cannot? One comment mentioned that the developers might have student loans to pay off, but that's countered by the working class family might have to pay a lot to add their kids to their health insurance.<p>Same question for New York, and any other place where people consider $100k/year too low to be a living wage for a programmer.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=4639071&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%38%32%38%36">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="../ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_4639110 href="http://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4639110&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%38%32%38%36"><img src="../ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_4639110></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=doomlaser">doomlaser</a> 9 hours ago  | <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4639110">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Yes, and they spend nearly $400M per quarter to generate that revenue. Using more precise numbers, their net loss over the last 4 quarters was about $0.73 per share. By my rule of thumb of awarding a P/E of 10, that makes the business worth -$7.30 per share.<p>Now in reality, that is a very simplistic analysis, and in point of fact, I do perceive some value in the business, just not very much. It is something that is very hard to quantify (as are other intangibles like copyrights and trademarks). In the end, I do have to go with my gut a little bit (as you say "an emotional valuation"). I don't personally have much use for Zynga's games or their business model, so I am aware that I might undervalue them somewhat, but what the the numbers tell me is that they are a poor business to invest in even at this "low" price.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>A company that generates $300M per quarter has a "real" business, despite your disdain for their business model.  
ZNGA isn't like a business that spends $100 in ads to make $80 in ad clicks.  They are making real games that millions of people appear to enjoy.  I myself don't enjoy them, either, but I'm not going to just dismiss their business as having no value.<p>The main problem for them is that they haven't grown their revenues as quickly as they need to.  But in order to turn themselves into a profitable business, all they need to do is cut costs.  I've been to their offices and talked to friends that worked there, so I know there's plenty of room to cut costs.  That being said, if their revenues drop, they could be in for real trouble.<p>That being said, I just dumped my entire position today (with my luck, right at the very bottom).  My biggest fear is that their revenues keep falling, and they die death-by-a-thousand-cuts.  If this quarter is a kitchen-sink quarter, then I might pick some up after they release their official numbers.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=4639411&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%38%32%38%36">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="../ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_4639229 href="http://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4639229&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%38%32%38%36"><img src="../ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_4639229></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=firebones">firebones</a> 8 hours ago  | <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4639229">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Wait so you think it's reasonable to bank on some uncertain future benefit to pan out, and expect people to be 'heartbroken' when it doesn't go through? Come on, you don't mean that, do you?<p>When I worked for a startup, I only considered my salary in my financial decisions. This also meant that I could switch jobs and be reasonably certain that my standard of living wouldn't change. We were offered equity as well, and the agreement we had to sign had several provisions that I could only describe as being pro-founder/anti-employee. For example:<p>1. Upon termination of employment (for any reason), the company can buy back your shares at book price, whether you like it or not. In other words: You'll never see a big payout from your work if you go.<p>2. There should be no expectation of a market for the shares in the company, and there may never be one. Again, good luck selling those shares.<p>3. The founder has the right to sell his shares, but employees have no tag-along right. So even if the company is sold, you will probably not be able to cash in at that point, since your labor/skill are part of the sale.<p>4. The employees' shares are subject to dilution. How much dilution? Who knows, maybe 1%, maybe 99%, whatever's good in the view of the founders.<p>This stuff is pretty standard, too. What I don't get though is how people will make multi-decade (i.e. mortgage, kids) financial decisions on a benefit that's this uncertain. Instead of actual equity, they could just say "we'll give you more money later if we get rich and feel like it". At least it would be more honest.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=4638927&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%38%32%38%36">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="../ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=160></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_4638841 href="http://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4638841&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%38%32%38%36"><img src="../ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_4638841></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jrockway">jrockway</a> 11 hours ago  | <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4638841">link</a></span></div><br>

That means nobody can make him do anything and he has a very long time to get his house in order.<p>All they would have to do to make Wall Street happy now is lay-off a whole bunch of people and start making 20% profit.

Not planning for growth.<p>Zynga is in a great position for real-money gaming, as just one possible avenue for future growth. The US government is taking longer than expected to regulate that industry but they will get around to it.<p>Zynga has been public for less than a year and they've got many years of runway left even if things don't improve.

    (NASDAQ:ZNGA), this time now with the exit of Laurence “Lo” Toney, an executive 
    who oversaw the company’s hugely popular online poker game.

    Tony’s exit was revealed via his LinkedIn profile, where he changed his current 
    profession to “mentor at MuckerLab,” a Los Angeles startup accelerator, and 
    lists Zynga Inc (NASDAQ:ZNGA) among his previous professions.

    [...]

    Tony now joins the list of top-level executives who left Zynga Inc 
    (NASDAQ:ZNGA) in the past couple of months. In September, Chief technology 
    officer Allan Leinwand and chief marketing and revenue officer Jeff Karp 
    resigned, while in August, chief operating officer John Schappert and chief 
    creative officer Mike Verdu left the company. Not only this, but the game maker 
    also witnessed the exit of two vice presidents, Bill Mooney and Brian 
    Birtwistle, at the end of August.</code></pre></font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=4638413&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%38%32%38%36">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="../ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_4638605 href="http://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4638605&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%38%32%38%36"><img src="../ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_4638605></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=DanBlake">DanBlake</a> 12 hours ago  | <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4638605">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Do you mean why, or how?<p>As to "why", equity values are often more about emotion than reality (sometimes much more). Sometimes people want to bail from a stock that's become unpopular, and they don't bother to notice that the stock valuation is lower than the value of the buildings and inventory.<p>As to "how", there's nothing to stop a market valuation from being lower than the most basic assessment of the physical value of a company's assets, separate from present and future business prospects.<p>The single most important thing to remember about equities is that decisions need to be based to some extent on how stockholders think and behave, not necessarily on what makes sense.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>&#62; <i>" I don't understand why people on Reddit and HN love to demonize the employees of Zynga."</i><p>I apologize if I give offense while attempting to shed some light on why people have a problem with your company (and those who choose to work there).  It's difficult to be honest about this question without coming across as mean, but I will try.<p>1) wholesale copying other companies' games (see <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/101954002/EA-v-Zynga-Complaint-Final" rel="nofollow">http://www.scribd.com/doc/101954002/EA-v-Zynga-Complaint-Fin...</a> for a legal complaint and <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4335287" rel="nofollow">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4335287</a> for discussion.)  From that thread: <i>"they must realize that every day they go to work and rip off someone's original work."</i>  It's hard to respect someone who knowingly makes their living this way.<p>2) The game mechanics of Zynga games often hinge on what might be viewed as "bad" use of psychology -- manipulative, addictive, and in a sense abusive of the friends functionality of facebook.  It's hard to respect someone who knowingly treats people so callously.<p>3) Common opinion is that the games themselves range from mildly awful to completely terrible, and are successful almost entirely due to the "bad" psychology above.  It's easy to respect someone like notch, who got rich making an awesome game.  It's hard to respect people like Pincus, who got rich by making games that are fundamentally lame.<p>Again, no offense meant to you or your friends.  Maybe you're on a team that doesn't do any of the above bad stuff.  But the parts of Zynga most of us are familiar with do all of that bad stuff.  I hope this helps clarify why you might see so much hate directed that way.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=4639501&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%38%32%38%36">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="../ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_4640080 href="http://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4640080&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%38%32%38%36"><img src="../ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_4640080></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=irreverentbits">irreverentbits</a> 2 hours ago  | <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4640080">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Honestly, this is ridiculous.<p>1. The vast majority of the games industry borrows heavily from titles which have come before, so Zynga isn't unique in this regard, nor should it be singled out.<p>2.

Subjective statements about quality aside, I think it's safe to say that Minecraft has highly addictive qualities, and therefore Notch can't really be put on a pedestal here in the context of your second assertion.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=4640080&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%38%32%38%36">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="../ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_4640335 href="http://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4640335&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%38%32%38%36"><img src="../ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_4640335></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=chucknelson">chucknelson</a> 9 minutes ago  | <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4640335">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Not exactly the way it would work, basically the way things are valued you can't necessarily get that much money for them. In the ideal world there would be a business there too.<p>Now all of this is moot if Zynga is making enough money to pay the bills, doesn't matter what their stock price is if they don't have to sell stock to raise money. So the thing to look at is when their obligations exceed their assets, that is when they are 'upside down' in the lingo. Very hard to recover from that because you can't even borrow money temporarily when that happens, you have to save money, then use the money you saved to do the thing you wanted to do, rinse and repeat and that removes your ability to react quickly.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=4638587&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%38%32%38%36">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="../ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_4638665 href="http://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4638665&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%38%32%38%36"><img src="../ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_4638665></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=_delirium">_delirium</a> 12 hours ago  | <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4638665">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>It is baffling that analysts can essentially divide their guidance by 2 overnight. With such "guidance", it's easy for small investors to get fleeced. And with everyone in the industry gloating about how we saw it coming, it's only going to make us all look a little less trustworthy.
