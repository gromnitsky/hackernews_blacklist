<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>disagree. I have it on good authority that education begins from around year 0. And the folks that begin learning how computers work, and programming, at say age 10 are generally going to be much better off, and better hires, than folks that don't begin that step until age 18 or 22 or what have you. Getting a paycheck doesn't inherently teach you anything more about CS or engineering or development practices. It's just money. Having a job means you do get exposed to a lot more stuff <i>around</i> programming, like politics, bureaucracy, personalities, management, corporate shenanigans, methodologies, clients, customers, etc. Yes maybe even more exposure to certain technical things you might not have had exposure to it.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I've concluded that the "years of work in [industry|&#60;tech&#62;]" meme is a fuzzy, noisy, unreliable and (close to) meaningless metric. Note I said "(close to) meaningless", because it is not completely. It makes the classic error of making an apples-to-oranges comparison. For example, too many people talk about "5 years of Java" as if they were talking about a 5 meter long pole. If pole lengths were measured in the same way as "years of Java", and you went to buy 10 different poles from different stores, each "5 years of Java" in length, you are going to be in for a nasty surprise.

Like most others, I love playing around with widgets and technology just for fun and to see what happens. But the satisfaction from this is usually short lived.<p>I liken playing around with techology to running around and having lots of good sex with strangers. It's fun and it feels great, but sooner or later, you'll want something more substantial. For me, that requires the satisfaction of others.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I turned 41 yesterday. Have been programming for over 18 years. Like you I also love it. And since work coding does not offer me enough of a challenge always. I like to do some fun (challenge kind of) coding on my own. Some random examples of the fun programming I have done:<p>1) When I started out programming, some two decades back, I did a program which was tough for me then (I believe its a pretty standard program given to people who are learning programming). It was - 'How to place 8 queens on a chess board so that they don't attack each other'.<p>2) A C -program which prints itself.<p>3) More recently I read Norvig's solving every Sudoku puzzle (<a href="http://norvig.com/sudoku.html" rel="nofollow">http://norvig.com/sudoku.html</a>), so went ahead and wrote my own (without looking at his solution of course).<p>4) Solving this ('Going Office' on Interview Street : <a href="https://www.interviewstreet.com/challenges/dashboard/#problem/4f6522ab2f425" rel="nofollow">https://www.interviewstreet.com/challenges/dashboard/#proble...</a>) one gave me immense amount of satisfaction, when I did a couple of months back. As I had not done complicated graph stuff earlier.  I game my family a treat, just because I was so happy when all my test cases passed :-)<p>So programming has been a joy of my life. Hope to do it for many more years. Will try.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=4616735&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%31%31%33%33%37">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="../ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_4612123 href="http://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4612123&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%31%31%33%33%37"><img src="../ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_4612123></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Tichy">Tichy</a> 1 day ago  | <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4612123">link</a></span></div><br>

How do you put your skills to good?<p>I’ve always thought that the best way to put your technical skills to the greater good is through your day job, not instead of it.<p>Some of my days jobs have been to write software to ensure that:<p><pre><code>  - people get the right prescription medication on time
  - firetrucks and ambulances get to where they're supposed to be
  - parts that go into cars and planes are properly certified
  - prisoners are kept in jail
  - those same prisoners get proper medical care
  - electronic equipment gets assembled properly and on time
  - medical supplies get dispatched to where they're supposed to
  - insurance claims are processed properly
  - quality data is properly maintained for food items

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Although I don't really use the word 'cog,' you are being uncharitable here; the word isn't completely meaningless and using it isn't "screeching".<p>The poster seemed to be distinguishing not on the basis of interdependence but on the basis of who has control over your life and the context of your work, and where the resulting profit would go. (This is, of course, my reading).<p>One part is your freedom. If you want to take a trip for a couple weeks once a year, or change your hairstyle or get a tattoo, and this is impossible because of company regulations unrelated to workload, this is coggy. Of course, everyone acknowledges that you have to work a certain amount of time and that if you are facing employees it helps not to have a swastika tattoo on your forehead, etc.<p>Another part is the alignment of what you are doing with your interests. If you are putting in 60 hours to pay the bills and learn a lot about SOAP on the way, that's coggy; it is not the same as choosing work that involves SOAP because it gives you a hard-on, which is less coggy.<p>Another part is what determines the broader role your work plays. Yes, everyone is doing work which fits into other people's wants (even the arctic explorer is playing to an audience somehow). But if you work for 8 months on something and it fails because customers hate it, you were still the one who chose that context - less coggy. It was trying an idea. If you work for 8 months and then it is permanently scrapped because the company came to a deal with Microsoft and your project was just a bargaining chip, that's coggy.<p>For the same reason, profits - if you are working in Hollywood and get paid an incredibly tiny amount for a hit movie because they got you with Hollywood accounting, that is coggy; it's less coggy if your profit is tied<p>Of course, this also means it's less coggy if you are taking on greater risk (financial, reputational, whatever). If you are very risk averse then you may prefer a coggier position. If you are very focused on one specialized skill, a less coggy position might force you to pick up other ones, so again certain kinds of people will rationally prefer coggier positions.<p>If the norm is for employees to be hired at low rates, dominated in every way possible, artificially hampered from building useful things, and fired on a dime, that is pretty coggy. If you are happily choosing your own jobs, leaving when you want, dictating terms, that isn't very coggy. Which is why you used it as your example.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=4613195&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%31%31%33%33%37">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="../ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=240></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_4613894 href="http://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4613894&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%31%31%33%33%37"><img src="../ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_4613894></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jerf">jerf</a> 1 day ago  | <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4613894">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Programming, by itself, the mechanics of it, isn't something that I find stimulative enough to derive long-term enjoyment.<p>I think the author is right in pointing out that there's an ugly side to programming that includes bugs, bad API's, bad tools, bad documentation, etc.<p>This is what I have come to term "programmer on programmer violence".  We certainly can't blame anyone else for these issues.<p>This I don't enjoy.<p>Not to single them out --because EVERYONE has these issues-- but you look at the bullshit you have to deal with when doing iOS programming and, yes, it can be down-right demoralizing.  Horrible documentation, an IDE that looks more like an iTunes-styled toy than a professional development system, bugs, bugs!, no feedback, huge delays in fixing problems, etc.<p>Again, this isn't just about Apple, as nearly every system I've worked on over the years has some kind of bullshit that you have to deal with, like it or not.<p>This, I do not enjoy.<p>That's why, when justified, I've always gone for projects where I can "own" all of the code.  Two typical cases are FPGA-based projects where you start with a blank slate of sorts and develop it into a useful signal processing subsystem.  Or, embedded systems where I've had the chance to roll my own RTOS from scratch.  These projects are fun.  And you don't have to deal with other people's bullshit, laziness, incompetence and technical baggage.<p>These projects I really enjoy.<p>The other side of this question is: If you didn't program, what would you do?<p>I am an odd duck. I am equally at home designing multi-gigahertz digital circuits, programming embedded systems, FPGA signal processors, iOS apps, workstation apps, websites, doing mechanical design and even running a CNC shop.  I've been lucky enough to have had the opportunity to learn tons of disciplines through hours-upon-hours of hard-work and dedication.  I've enjoyed every minute of it.<p>What I have not enjoyed --and I'll try not to get too political here-- is when your efforts are affected or even destroyed by external --political-- forces.  I recently had to close down a beautiful electronics manufacturing operation that took me fifteen years to build.  Typical story:  Started in the garage.  Worked my ass off. Learned a ton of stuff I didn't know.  Worked some more.  Grew it to a 15 employee company in a 10,000 square foot building with top-notch manufacturing equipment.  That's the good side of the story.<p>While I was busy doing this, fucking idiots, otherwise known as politicians, where busy meddling with free markets and passing laws and regs that would, ultimately, cause the economic implosion in 2008.  My customers couldn't finance their purchases (this was B-to-B in a mostly leased-equipment environment) and orders went to zero or nearly zero instantly.  There's a lot more to it, but that's the basics.  At one point no option remained but to fire everyone and shut it down.<p>How does this relate to the "Would you want to be doing this at 50?" question?<p>Be careful about doing something or falling in love with something that external forces can seriously affect, damage or take away.  For me I'll generalize and call this "manufacturing".  No, I don't want to be in manufacturing any more.  Not now, not when I am 50.  It's a shit business in the US and, between our politicians and what's going on in China, it is getting destroyed a little more every day.  Here's a case of having invested fifteen years of my life into something that the government destroyed.  I did not destroy it.  None of my actions caused the economic downturn. None of my employees or my customers caused it.  It was government policy that allowed millions of people making $50K a year to buy $500,000 homes they could not afford.  And so it went.<p>The software industry, as fucked-up as it can feel from time to time, can have a lot more isolation from these issues.  That's not to say that it isn't affected by economic ebbs and flows, it is.<p>There's a fundamental difference between the nature of a software business and, say, a manufacturing business.  At any given time I had to have one to two million dollars in inventory, tools and equipment (parts, assemblies, raw materials, manufacturing equipment, tools, infrastructure) in order to be a small manufacturer. And, when things go bad, this infrastructure is sitting there, right above your head, ready to squash you, ready to kill you off unceremoniously.  It can happen almost literally overnight.<p>Software is different in that infrastructure is minimal and there is no real inventory investment.  You can do software from your bedroom and build a nice lifestyle business or million dollar venture.  Most importantly, software is incredible in that you can pivot overnight.  You can be doing children's educational apps one day and a real-time process monitoring system the next.  This allows for great security and potential stability for years and years.  This is a huge advantage and, yes, this is something that would be desirable to have in your life at fifty and beyond.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=4613363&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%31%31%33%33%37">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="../ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_4614932 href="http://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4614932&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%31%31%33%33%37"><img src="../ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_4614932></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=adamc">adamc</a> 1 day ago  | <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4614932">link</a></span></div><br>

The requirement to prove that you have some sort of income before getting a house loan was one of the things deregulation "fixed".

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Please note extremely effective demonstration of "privilege".<p>Two employee candidates interview successively. One is 25, the other 53. Both are comparably conversant in technology, evince comparable cognitive capability, are equivalently literate in the problem domain being tackled by the role they're interviewing for.<p>Privilege: the 25 year old is not asked (overtly or subtextually) whether they "want to be doing this". It is simply assumed that the 25 year old's head is in the game. No demonstration of lifestyle commitment to the craft is required.<p>Take the idea and turn it around in your hands for a little while. Try this: imagine that instead of software developers, these were master woodcrafters; luthiers, say. Notice how the subtext changes: age is an asset. A lifetime spent designing guitars is a signifier of passion and competence. Flip the switch back to development and notice how age suddenly connotes something else, like "career failure forcing person to retain technical role".<p>You will get old someday, if you're lucky. But controlling for spectacularly unlikely values of "lucky", you are aren't going to strike gold in this field, such that you'll have no career concerns when you're 45-50. It is unfortunate that our field manages to devalue competence and experience that way it does; here's a second-time Rails gem author instead of a virtual memory system designer, see you at SXSW!</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=4613767&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%31%31%33%33%37">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="../ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_4615013 href="http://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4615013&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%31%31%33%33%37"><img src="../ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_4615013></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mechanical_fish">mechanical_fish</a> 1 day ago  | <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4615013">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>It's about the rate of change. Luthiers are practicing an art that would be recognizable to Stradivari, three hundred years ago. The tools are made of more modern materials but they're basically the same. The product has a more modern design (both functionally and stylistically) but is basically the same.<p>More importantly, the culture and business of instrument-making is largely the same. You have a shop in your garage or basement, or in the back of your store. You make instruments by hand a few at a time and sell them, preferably for cash, to individual buyers. You learn by apprenticing with someone who knows, or reading books and practicing like crazy for decades. Maybe you'll scale up to a factory with a few dozen journeymen cranking out instruments… like Stradivari did, three hundred years ago.<p>The problem with programming is that it's unstable. And I contend that it isn't even the unstable languages and platforms that hurt (as everyone says, experience makes it <i>easier</i> to learn new languages). Nor is it the eternal brokenness and turnover of APIs. This is not a new problem, nor does the patience to deal with it necessarily decline with age. Indeed, to an extent the opposite is true: experience has taught me not to panic when my favorite API is shot out from under me. (The first time it happens is a really awful surprise and a test of your patience, but the fifth time it happens you're probably used to it.)<p>No, I think the real problem is the constant turnover in <i>culture</i>. Programming in the late 1980s, for example, was a <i>completely</i> different social universe than web consulting in PHP, or iOS development: Different typical org structure, different business model, different way of learning the trade, different communities and communications channels, different career tracks, different project management styles, different constraints, different everything.<p>Immersing yourself in a new culture is <i>hard</i>. You're going to get schooled by kindergarteners, so check your pride at the door. And you're going to have to relearn your whole approach to the business, not just a new syntax or a new set of APIs. You're even going to need to learn new jokes. And the biggest challenge of all is that your old culture rarely dies cleanly, so you're never quite sure if you're doing the right thing by becoming an expatriate. Why not just go home, where you have the seniority and the contacts, where you know the old stories and can visit the old hangouts? The old way is shrinking, but is it really time for the funeral?</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=4615013&amp;whence=%74%68%72%65%61%64%73%3f%69%64%3d%74%70%74%61%63%65%6b">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="../ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_4617192 href="http://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4617192&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%31%31%33%33%37"><img src="../ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_4617192></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=tptacek">tptacek</a> 10 hours ago  | <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4617192">link</a></span></div><br>

The hard part is figuring out a way to be a full-time engineer but retain manager-level clout.<p>Many engineers think that actually becoming managers will give them what they need to enjoy engineering again, but the problem is that this strategy doesn't work.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I like that idea as well, but the problem is that your manager will, over the long term, change. Most people have no insurance against some person they've never met being hired above them. You need enough independent credibility to protect yourself against that. You have 5 years of managerial experience, so you probably have enough work experience that any job move would be a likely promotion, so your company has incentives not to treat you badly.<p>I used to think the software industry was about programming: writing great code to solve hard problems. It's not. It's about credibility and technical risk. The software industry is 90% industry and only 10% software. Most of your time will be spent convincing people to allow you to do useful stuff, not actually doing useful stuff.<p>The ironic thing is that, as software jobs increasingly slide toward looking more like widget-making and less like research, programmers become a lot less effective.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>&#62; I worry that as the job of programming matures, we are losing track of that fundamental insight.<p>Reminds me of the intro to SICP:<p>“I think that it’s extraordinarily important that we in computer science keep
fun in computing. When it started out, it was an awful lot of fun. Of course,
the paying customers got shafted every now and then, and after a while we began
to take their complaints seriously. We began to feel as if we really were
responsible for the successful, error-free perfect use of these machines. I
don’t think we are. I think we’re responsible for stretching them, setting them
off in new directions and keeping fun in the house. I hope the field of
computer science never loses its sense of fun. Above all, I hope we don’t
become missionaries. Don’t feel as if you’re Bible salesmen. The world has
too many of those already. What you know about computing other people will
learn. Don’t feel as if the key to successful computing is only in your hands.
What’s in your hands, I think and hope, is intelligence: the ability to see the
machine as more than when you were first led up to it, that you can make it
more.”

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>The interesting idea in the post(beyond the programming vs age bit, which is sure to trigger some rage,) is this<p>"To me, there's an innate frustration in programming. It doesn't stem from having to work out the solutions to difficult problems. That takes careful thought, but it's the same kind of thought a novelist uses to organize a story or to write dialog that rings true. That kind of problem-solving is satisfying, even fun.<p>But that, unfortunately, is not what most programming is about. It's about trying to come up with a working solution in a problem domain that you don't fully understand and don't have time to understand."<p>If this is a problem that affects you don't do 'most programming'. Nothing really stops a developer from learning a problem domain with economic potential. Sure you may have to go to school or read some books or get some experience, but so what?<p>The idea that a programmer always has to work in a half understood domain transforming some one else's ideas into code is just that, an idea. It is a dominant idea, but nothing really stops anyone from mastering an interesting domain in addition to programming.<p>Knowing how to program is like knowing how to  write (in a largely illiterate society, so your knowledge has economic value). Or like knowing how to cast spells. Yes, if you spend all your life scribing other people's thoughts or casting spells to manifest other people's wishes, it could get boring. Could, but doesn't have to be. You don't <i>have</i> to be a scribe just because you know how to write.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=4611451&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%31%31%33%33%37">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="../ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_4611577 href="http://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4611577&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%31%31%33%33%37"><img src="../ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_4611577></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jacquesm">jacquesm</a> 1 day ago  | <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4611577">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>@Jacquesm,
I agree with your FU money concept and I am actively working on that. I think this comment is a byproduct (side-effect?! (-;) of your having achieved FI.<p>But what you mentioned here is what I would consider "Let them eat cake instead" advice.  :)<p>Not well thought out.<p>Nostalgia is a very powerful emotion, and besides historical perspectives are based on whatever set of lenses you choose to wear. Actually, our grandparents (even parents) had more time in their lives, more variety in their lives that was completely unrelated to their 9-5 routines, their professional lives were (mostly) on autopilot, so they had more free time to pursue all kinds of hobbies and tinkering, while still working on a daily job! So, yes I am looking at grandparents too, but I chose to wear different lenses.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=4611937&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%31%31%33%33%37">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="../ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_4611987 href="http://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4611987&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%31%31%33%33%37"><img src="../ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_4611987></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jacquesm">jacquesm</a> 1 day ago  | <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4611987">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>In my experience it's not so much about missing deadlines with impunity, as negotiating up front what you're willing to commit to delivering. A lot of times you can put off some "nice to have" features without anyone complaining, as long as the core functionality is ready on time. (That may be what you meant by "delaying.")<p>The other part is renegotiating timelines when they make changes to stuff you've already built.<p>Financial security helps but the real key is being skilled enough to accomplish a lot without breaking a sweat. As much as possible, build reusable components with nice APIs, even if it means putting in some extra time up front.

There is no substitute for this.  It has helped me identify design areas that I need experience with.  It has also helped me reason about code more efficiently, which is a very useful skill when interacting with other programmers.<p>Edit:  And then I go home and read HN and /r/programming and play with other programming languages and build stupid little programs and read my books and try to figure out my next move...</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=4612157&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%31%31%33%33%37">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="../ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_4611983 href="http://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4611983&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%31%31%33%33%37"><img src="../ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_4611983></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=adamc">adamc</a> 1 day ago  | <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4611983">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I don't know squat about your specific examples, but I couldn't agree more with the general principle.  In my sub-field, the obvious example is the ISO-designed STEP file format, which several times longer than the older IGES standard (exact count is hard to get because the STEP standard is split up into dozens of books, not all necessarily relevant) yet is drastically less specific about how you actually put together a meaningful file.<p>For instance, the STEP AP203 standards document is 500+ pages long.  (That's the old edition, I don't have a printed copy of the second edition handy.)  But those pages don't tell you how to use the hundreds of classes they define to actually create a meaningful file.  For that you need the supplemental "recommended practices" document (<a href="http://www.steptools.com/support/stdev_docs/express/ap203/recprac203v8.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.steptools.com/support/stdev_docs/express/ap203/re...</a>), which has been marked "preliminary" for the last 14 years and is itself not particularly clear. (On the bright side, at least it's free!)<p>Of course, that only applies to one of the many different STEP application protocols, and while I did find a reference to an AP214 (which I also need to support) recommended practices document, the link to it was dead.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=4611856&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%31%31%33%33%37">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="../ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_4612414 href="http://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4612414&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%31%31%33%33%37"><img src="../ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_4612414></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=outside1234">outside1234</a> 1 day ago  | <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4612414">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>40 year old here.   The key to a long enjoyable career is making sure you really love 80% of the work you do in your role.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>That's solved long ago.<p>There are some underlying concepts, foundation ideas which didn't change much since 1960-70-80s, the time when they have been discovered, studied and defined.<p>Yes, people are piling up tons of crap in order to get money, and this is how we got a millions lines of meaningless Java code which no one could understand or maintain, which seems to work well only because most of unit-tests passed and hardware is so cheap.<p>I don't even want to mention current Javascript madness.<p>At the same time, however, almost nothing were added to the ideas expressed by John McCarthy, and followers.<p>Yes. They are stuffing tons of useless crap into new Scheme standard, as they did with Common Lisp, but, the underlying ideas and the principles of "less is more" and "good enough" remain unshaken, like mountains in Nepal.)<p>In a very rare occasions we still can witness some miracles. For example, the source code of this site - the engine <i>and the language translator in which it written</i> is less than one megabyte. (just imagine what amount of traffic it handles and how much money already created).<p>There are also Plan9, nginx and few other wonders.<p>So, in ones 50s one, perhaps, should enjoy knowing and applying these principles and ideas and produce ones own small wonders.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I'm literally going through this at the moment.<p>I'm currently 24.<p>I do still love programming, and I'd like to think i'm pretty damn good at it. But do I want to be doing it as a job in 30 years time? I'm not so sure anymore.<p>I've been through one software job at the very loose-and-fast end of software development, but the pace (and a huge amount of overtime) burnt me out. I got to the stage where I couldn't get myself out of bed to go to work the next day. Over time I recovered somewhat, but I just wasn't enthusiastic about the work anymore.<p>My current job is at the complete opposite end of the spectrum. Medical software development is very slow, conservative, and methodical. To be honest I can see why most of the companies in this industry are at the thousands-to-tens-of-thousands scale; you literally need that critical mass in terms of staffing to deal with all of the overhead associated with a medical product. Reports, standards, committees, meetings, audits. And yet this company is doing it with less than 10 people.<p>It's really feel-good work, but it is really easy to get bogged down in the day-do-day drudgery and overhead, to the point where you completely miss the big picture of helping save peoples' lives. Do I want to be doing this when i'm 50? I don't think so.<p>In general in software development there's a couple of things that I've realized you have to work really hard at to have as a software developer. I've also discovered that both of these are much more important to me than I used to think:<p>-- Physical health and fitness: if you're sitting statically in a chair for 8-16 hours a day you have to really watch your diet and make continuous conscious efforts to exercise at every opportunity: it's going to catch up with you eventually (especially by the time you get to that 50 mark).<p>-- Varied and changing environments: both of my parents have "desk jobs", but both have extensive trips out of the office to visit customers or other sites. As a programmer I don't get this variety (the spice of life), so it's very easy to get bogged down and forget the big picture. I think this also leads to getting stuck in mental and emotional loops, due to a lack of external stimulus (kind of like what people who work from home report).<p>Nothing prepares you for actually being in a 9-5 programming job. At university it was obvious that there were people who were able to pass tests well enough, but would obviously struggle to code their way out of a paper bag. What about the people like myself, who are competent and practical, but are not prepared mentally to handle the rigors of 9-5 programming? Maybe that's why there is a shortage of labour in this sector: not only are we struggling to find people who are excited about programming and skilled at it, but we also struggle to find people who can handle working in these commercial scenarios?<p>There are also a number of companies that aren't like the examples above, especially in SV. But the problem with that is that not all of us are, or want to be, in Silicon Valley. Could I start my own company? Maybe, but that's not where my competencies or passions lie, at least currently.<p>Some deep thought is required about where exactly I will go next, given the time and effort I've invested up till this point into electronics, computers and programming.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=4614408&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%31%31%33%33%37">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="../ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_4613127 href="http://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4613127&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%31%31%33%33%37"><img src="../ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_4613127></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Stratoscope">Stratoscope</a> 1 day ago  | <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4613127">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I'm 60 and have been programming for 44 years. This year I'm working on election maps for Google. I still like learning new languages - this year it's PostgreSQL and PostGIS, Go, Autohotkey (a very strange language!), and now TypeScript (not quite a new language).<p>One thing I get an odd pleasure out of is when other programmers use phrases and styles I came up with years ago. A recent example is the $ prefix on a JavaScript variable containing a jQuery object:<p><pre><code>    // Set $test to a jQuery object and test to the DOM object
    var $test = $('#test'), test = $test[0];
</code></pre>
I just saw someone explaining that on reddit last night and it gave me a smile.<p>Much longer ago, I coined the phrase "fire an event" back in the 80's when I was designing the VBX interface for Visual Basic (then called Ruby). Alas, not all the names I coined for that project survived: VB Controls were originally called Gizmos, which I thought was a much more fun name.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>"It's about trying to come up with a working solution in a problem domain that you don't fully understand and don't have time to understand."<p>Hrm... it's like that for me, but it's not like that for others I know.  Some people I know have worked in the same industry for several years and have a good grasp on the problem domains they address.  That doesn't mean they know the solution to everything off the top of their head, but it  does mean they'll likely have time to figure it out, as they're in that business for the long term, and have incentives to get it right vs 'fire and forget and move to the next project'.<p>I'm in my 40s and have been programming, for 30 years.  Initially as a hobby (obviously) but getting paid to do it, first part time, then full time, for about 20 years.  I had this same conversation with an uncle last year - shouldn't I be doing something else (OK, not quite the same tone as the OP, but we had the discussion).<p>I have skills that allow me to solve problems for people.  Many people do as well, but with software, I do it with electrons, and can do it wherever and whenever I want.  In contrast to many other types of work which dictate location, tools, timing, software work is incredibly flexible.  But... more to the point, as more of the world continues to become software-based, the opportunities to offer my problem-solving skills to people increases at a rate few other industries/skills have enjoyed (or will continue to enjoy).<p>Even if I switched focus to work in "company X" vs "company Y", my core ability will still be "problem solving with software" - I just don't see that changing for me over the next 20-30 years.  The 'how' and 'who' may change, but probably not the 'what' so much.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=4612163&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%31%31%33%33%37">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="../ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_4611888 href="http://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4611888&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%31%31%33%33%37"><img src="../ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_4611888></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Surio">Surio</a> 1 day ago  | <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4611888">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Remember the mantra - "location, location..", and also context. In other words, where you are working (geolocation of company, and therefore the strategic operations concentrated in that place, company size, technology, etc.), what you do on a daily basis, whether you are doing things like "skimming great oceans of APIs, but the market will have moved" day in and day out. (There's a lot of gems in that article, BTW)<p>Add to my above para, this other gem of an observation:<p>&#60;blockquote&#62;
 If you're fresh out of school, there are free Starbucks lattes down the hall, and all your friends are still at the office at 2 AM, too...well, that works. But then you have to do it again. And again. It's always a last second skid at 120 miles per hour with brakes smoking and tires shredding that makes all the difference between success and failure, but you pulled off another miracle and survived to do it again. 
&#60;/blockquote&#62;<p>That article really resonated with me. And, no I can't see myself doing it at 50 :-)<p>EDIT: One more thing to add with regards to context of operations, rewards are also skewed in favour of management rather than "engineers", so at some point mortgage, loans, education and medical expenses will overshadow 'fun'.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=4611888&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%31%31%33%33%37">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="../ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_4612803 href="http://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4612803&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%31%31%33%33%37"><img src="../ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_4612803></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=agentultra">agentultra</a> 1 day ago  | <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4612803">link</a></span></div><br>

Basically you have answered the OP's main angst. There are names for this kind of thing, you know ("Ageism"?).  Also, because of these kinds of actions, these people are simply losing their 'relevance' within the context of the organisation's overall strategic direction. Now how bad do you think it is for one's morale and self-actualisation?  In a way, damned if you do, damned if you don't, isn' it?<p>Also, in some orgs, the "seniors"  are "expected to understand the architecture" (read: more arcana and API call memorisations) so they can "guide"/"mentor" the "juniors" and "participate" in "propelling" the organisation, blah blah. And this invariably leads to what the OP's saying &#62;&#62;It's about skimming great oceans of APIs that you could spend years studying and learning, but the market will have moved on by then and that's no fun anyway&#60;&#60;</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=4612041&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%31%31%33%33%37">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="../ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_4612067 href="http://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4612067&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%31%31%33%33%37"><img src="../ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_4612067></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=lincolnq">lincolnq</a> 1 day ago  | <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4612067">link</a></span></div><br>

I am sure wherever you live, in la la land, you wake up smiling, sipping your coffee, checking tech blogs, dev sites, spending couple of hours learning a new technology and then when you feel like it you write a single PHP page and call it a day.  But let me tell you how the rest of us do it.  You wake up with a headache because you spent last night dreaming about all the meetings you had the day before. You chug your coffee hoping the headache will go. You spend 15 minutes catching up on emails and if you are lucky 15 on reading tech blogs and then the misery begins. In 15 minutes increments you jump from coding project 1 to a meeting to fixing project 2 to a meeting to learning about the domain of project 3 ... And then some douchebag in a meeting says why don't we use technology X and spend many days learning about it to build something we could've coded in couple of hours.  And then management says why don't we use technology Y because all the douchebags on the internet are talking about it. You try to make you case that we don't need any of that i.e. we don't need to use Hibernate for COUPLE of select/update/delete queries SQL is not that evil! and then even though most of the team agrees with you, no one has the guts to say it out loud. You return to you desk trying to remember the algorithm you were designing in your head but part of it is gone.  You jump from JAVA to .NET to PHP to javascript to C++ to SQL to Hibernate to jquery to YUI to MVC to mapper to, to, to ... You go back home, do whatever nightly routine you do and call it a day.
Sorry, passion is not the problem here. Software developer is a tough job and I know I can't do it when I am 50.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=4614789&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%31%31%33%33%37">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="../ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_4611586 href="http://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4611586&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%31%31%33%33%37"><img src="../ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_4611586></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=danso">danso</a> 1 day ago  | <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4611586">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I liked that article, it's a question I've asked myself numerous times. I love programming, been doing it for about 14 years now and I regularly find renewed interest.<p>I think one point that's maybe not stressed out enough here is that the passion for the activity itself doesn't necessarily have to do with a passion for the job related to that activity. I very often do things at my work I honestly wish I didn't have to do, a lot of it is really, really numb. Consequently, sometimes I think I wouldn't want to do that for too long, but then I realize the problem is the job itself, not programming.<p>There's also the question of whether I'll still be able to keep up with all the new stuff when I get older. I've often relied on the fact that I can adapt and learn things pretty quickly. Then I think back and it turns out that it's not so much a 'mechanical' problem, it's more of motivation problem. So I suppose as long as you can keep yourself motivated, you'll keep going.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=4615768&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%31%31%33%33%37">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="../ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_4614891 href="http://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4614891&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%31%31%33%33%37"><img src="../ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_4614891></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=rbanffy">rbanffy</a> 1 day ago  | <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4614891">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Whether I'm still programming when I'm 50 (currently 33, programming for about 20 years), will depend on whether I have the same appetite for being wrong that I do today.  To constantly program, you have to constantly learn, and to constantly learn, you have to constantly be confronted with the fact that you're doing it wrong.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I think it is very important to understand the "real" differences in what it means to program vs. manage. In programming in most cases you are working on projects. Once you deliver the code that project is essentially over (minus support and bug fixing of course). In a management role many of the key activities never really conclude. For example, resource allocation overall and amongst various projects, is something depending on circumstance, you may have to revisit on a weekly or monthly basis.  So you don't get the satisfaction of "delivering" anymore and items stay in your inbox much longer. This for me is the key difference.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=4611524&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%31%31%33%33%37">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="../ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_4614508 href="http://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4614508&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%31%31%33%33%37"><img src="../ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_4614508></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mandeepj">mandeepj</a> 1 day ago  | <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4614508">link</a></span></div><br>
