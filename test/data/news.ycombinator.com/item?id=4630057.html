<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">This presentation saddened me.<p>The presentation focused on what it perceived as missing features: structs (seriously?), classes, modules, syntactic sugar, macros, etc.  But the huge gaping holes in Javascript are not missing features.  They are fundamental errors in the language.  Things like ==, numbers as strings, eval, incorrect definitions of false, semicolon insertion, and -- heaven help us all -- improper lexical scoping.<p>Language designers tend to incrementally add junk to languages until they are complex, unweieldy monstrosities like C++ or Java.  Rarely do they fix fundamental errors in the language because that would require backward-incompatible changes.  So they stick to adding lipstick to the pig.  But JavaScript isn't like other languages: its fundamental errors are so glaring, and impact so negatively on the language, that the benefit of jumping to a "JavaScript 2.0" massively outweighs its incompatibility disadvantages.  That's why we see languages like CoffeeScript cropping up despite all their downsides, notably debugging.<p>The class bit particularly made me sad: JavaScript has a perfectly cromulent, even elegant, object model in the form of prototypes.  But a variety of syntactic sugar hacks, weird constructor stuff, and general desperation to be a class-based language have sullied what would otherwise be an elegant mechanism.  The solution appears to be: move more towards classes!  Thus we still have all the language hacks, and <i>two</i> generally incompatible object models to boot.  Plus structs!<p>Somehow after reading this presentation, I was struck with Yoda's admonition: Eich seems to be looking to the future, never his mind on where his language <i>was</i>.</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_4632704" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4632704&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%30%30%35%37"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_4632704"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=BrendanEich">BrendanEich</a> 849 days ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4632704">link</a><span class="deadmark"></span></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">You seem to misunderstand "structs" -- see <a href="http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:binary_data" rel="nofollow">http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:binary_data</a>, this is an extension of WebGL's typed arrays, which are already in all the new browsers (IE10 too).<p>As for implicit coercions, I enjoyed Gary Bernhardt's "Wat", referred to it, and at past talks even mocked along with. At Strange Loop, I went through each "Wat" in the "Wat Secrets Revealed" slide series (use down arrow when you see it greyed in).<p>Of course (!) I regret the implicit conversions that make == not an equivalence relation with disparate types on left and right (NaN is a different story: blame IEEE754). Who wouldn't? As I said at Strange Loop, some colleagues at Netscape were hot for lazy/loose number/string matching, and "I was an idiot! I gave them what they wanted."<p>There may be hope of fixing even ==, if we get macros done right. You would opt into macrology redefining == to be === or whatever you want. But this is in the future.<p>And that's the point: JS must grow compatibly, given its cursed/blessed position in the web. There is no other option that costs as little incrementally. True, we could paint into a corner. I don't see that happening, not with the vibrant and very smart JS developer community (communities, really) with whom we are working.<p>On a practical level, I once ran into someone who used to work at IDEO and became a JS hacker in the course of doing a startup. I asked him about == quirks and the like. He just shrugged and said "you learn what to avoid and move on." That is the voice of practical wisdom (until such time as macros help fix the quirks for good).<p>So my advice is cheer up!</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="80"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_4634168" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4634168&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%30%30%35%37"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_4634168"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jarel">jarel</a> 849 days ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4634168">link</a><span class="deadmark"></span></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Reading the macros first helps. They must be defined at top of program or module, if I recall sweetjs.org's design correctly, for the staged hygienic expansion to work well.<p>Aside from that, you're right. But JS has higher order functions and objects with ad-hoc methods, so it can be used according to many paradigms, which can make it hard for a reader unfamiliar with the dominant paradigm in code at hand.<p>This is not a deal-killer for macros, although with sweet.js as the prototyping tool, your assertion about "This is the job" is satisfied. Sweet.js works with node to do AOT macro expansion at present. There's effort to integrate it in the browser too, but this will be easier with ES6 module loaders (not yet prototyped in SpiderMonkey or V8).</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="160"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_4633447" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4633447&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%30%30%35%37"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_4633447"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=saebekassebil">saebekassebil</a> 849 days ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4633447">link</a><span class="deadmark"></span></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">&#62; The macro syntax is definitely not simple, and it could possibly get really complex for more elaborate syntactic definitions, thus rendering the source much less readable.<p>True, but the same can be said of any API. Reading the definitions can help but for both complex macros and complex APIs built today out of just functions and objects you need to document your abstractions. Macros don't change this, they just give you another abstraction axis (syntactic) to work with.<p>As with most things it just depends on how you use it. Sure you can abuse macros to make tons of crazy, undocumented, hard to understand syntactic extensions that destroy readability. But you can already do that today. Used wisely macros can increase readability, used poorly they can decrease it.<p>&#62; And does the effort to integrate macros into the browser mean that it'll be possible to evaluate macros "runtime"?<p>Not sure what you mean here. By definition macros are expanded at compile time (well, parse time really). The browser doesn't change this.</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="240"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_4635408" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4635408&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%30%30%35%37"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_4635408"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=saebekassebil">saebekassebil</a> 849 days ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4635408">link</a><span class="deadmark"></span></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">All abstractions can make your code unreadable; the key, as always, is to create good abstractions and document them clearly. Macros are syntactic abstractions. It's just as important to document them as it is for functions or objects. Of course, if you just have a little local macro that you're using for convenience, looking at the implementation may be sufficient. But when you write a macro that you want to share from a module, rather than requiring your clients to read the implementation, you document the syntax and the semantics, just like you would if you were writing a separate language.<p>But by having macros directly in JS, instead of having to use a whole language that compiles to JS, you can combine syntactic features from different sources. For example, right now there's no way to use one feature you like from CoffeeScript with another feature you like from TypeScript. You just can't combine them. But with macros, you could import two different syntaxes from two different libraries and use them in the same code.<p>On top of that, if we actually had macros in a future version of the standard, you wouldn't even have to precompile the macros offline, and you wouldn't need a preprocessing step at all. (For latency purposes, you might want to preprocess macros offline as an optimization. But for development, not having to do a preprocessing step is more convenient.)<p>Dave</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="160"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_4635428" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4635428&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%30%30%35%37"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_4635428"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=saebekassebil">saebekassebil</a> 849 days ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4635428">link</a><span class="deadmark"></span></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">So this is all in the holy name of making JavaScript the assembly language of the web? Making it possible for every JavaScripter to write "his own" JavaScript syntax definitions meaning that I'll (as a contributor or just casual watcher) would have to read his whole collection of macros before I could begin to understand the code?<p>I don't think this can be compared to API's as they still follow the regular syntactic definitions - This will be like reading a completely new language every time I read a different repository. (Of course this is a worst-case scenario as I imagine that many macros will be used across several projects, but still.)<p>Is all hope gone for writing vanilla JS gone? And isn't macros kinda going in the opposite direction than the ES specs?

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">I think you're being too hard on JavaScript there. Type coercion, ASI, and function scoping are all language features, not errors.  Likewise, eval is not an error; it's dangerous, but it's also a feature (and one that nearly all dynamic/scripted languages provide).  As Crockford said, "JavaScript is the only language people feel like they don't need to learn to use."  That statement alone describes why so many developers end up scratching their heads at stuff like `1 == "1"`. That's not an error or an oversight in the language - it's a feature that the developer didn't realize he/she was using.  It's hard to make it 10 minutes in ANY educational material on JavaScript that doesn't explain equality (==) vs identify (===) comparisons in JavaScript.<p>Lastly, the new class stuff doesn't actually change the inheritance/object models in JavaScript.  It's syntactic sugar on top of prototypes, and the "weird constructor stuff" is quite analogous to existing constructor functions.  For example, from the [ecmascript wiki](<a href="http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=strawman:maximally_minimal_classes" rel="nofollow">http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=strawman:maximally_mi...</a>): "Class declarations/expressions create a constructor function/prototype pair exactly as for function declarations."<p>I'm clearly a bit of a fanboi and obviously biased, so take all of this with a grain of salt - but most of these new language features are a good thing.  I'm glad to see JavaScript evolving in big ways.  It was getting boring watching new editions come out with nothing more interesting than Array.prototype.reduce in them.  Especially when you consider server-side contexts like Node.js, stuff like typed arrays, generators, Maps, etc. are welcome additions.</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="80"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_4633317" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4633317&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%30%30%35%37"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_4633317"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ianb">ianb</a> 849 days ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4633317">link</a><span class="deadmark"></span></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Sorry, missed the Yoda misquote at the end, I must respond!<p>Yoda said "where you <i>are</i>" but you used "was". Possibly just a tense-typo, but it matters. Tracking where JS <i>is</i> is a part of the TC39 job, but only a part. It's easy to fall into a trap where we standardize only what developers can express given the language's current semantics and so miss the chance to extend those semantics.<p>But I'll take the tense-corrected bait: yes, I talk about the future. The past (including its most recent instantaneous sample known as "the present") is greedy. With no one to look ahead or synthesize ideas from compile-to-JS and other languages that win user support, JS will tend to stagnate, all else equal. Champions (not just me) must fight for a better future.<p>Stagnation on the web is a social ill. It costs developers tons of time. We know this not only from IE6, but from Android 2.x WebKit. Some not-disinterested parties might want to make use of a crisis of this sort, to force a "new JS" (Dart? remember WPF and WPF/E in the past) to be adopted for want of anything to relieve the stagnation.<p>Not me. The cost is too high, the lessons learned in JS will be half- or three-quarters-lost, and too much code and developer brainprint will be thrown away. I'm reminded of the XML Utopia that was planned in w3.org to save us from bad old HTML, before a few of us called b.s. and started the whatwg.org to do HTML5.<p>The web is an evolving system, JS is part of the web standards and must evolve too. Skate where the puck will be.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">&#62; The web is an evolving system, JS is part of the web standards and must evolve too.<p>I don't see too many <i>language</i> gizmos in the presentation which reflect the requirements of web standards.  Most of them are extensions to a language which desperately needs modification more than extension at this time.  Evolution in a language is a matter of where you spend your development resources.  &#38;rest-args, weak maps, modules, and so on would be <i>nice</i> to have.  But I would gladly sacrifice them to the gods to get rid of JS's global variable issues.  It seems to me that ES is mostly building more and more features on top of a foundation of sand rather than taking a breath and revisiting how to reinforce the foundation.<p>Apple did this recently.  OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) was an entire release that consisted of almost nothing but cleaning house.  Few new features, just heavily revised internals.  It's probably the most important release Apple has done in a very long time.<p>Now one can make the argument that fundamental fixes to long-standing language flaws is a challenging thing to produce given the bulk of development work which relies on the old language.  That's a different discussion and one worth having.  But moving forward with gizmos simply for the "future"'s sake, without considering the current sad state of the language, is I think misguided.  I would strongly urge the committee to take a step back and identify the top twenty most problematic features of the language, and how they might be able to develop a "strict" version of the language which fixes those features, yet retains interoperability with code files written in non-strict form.  Then they can go back to adding new gizmos.<p>(BTW, the "was" is due to the original Empire quote).

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">&#62; The presentation focused on what it perceived as missing features: structs (seriously?), classes, modules, syntactic sugar, macros, etc.<p>The nature of a widely-used technology is that you can't remove features, you can only add. And yet adding features causes an increase in complexity. So what to do? The answer is to add features judiciously: prefer general features that cover a wide array of use cases and can provide better ways to do things that the existing features don't do or don't do well. (But also avoid over-general features that destroy important invariants -- for example, just say no to call/cc or threads.)<p>&#62; But the huge gaping holes in Javascript are not missing features. They are fundamental errors in the language. Things like ==, numbers as strings, eval, incorrect definitions of false, semicolon insertion, and -- heaven help us all -- improper lexical scoping.<p>ES6 -- and potentially down the road, macros -- are paving paths to fix many of these problems you mention, and other important problems besides (e.g., callback hell). Lexical scoping is partially improved with ES5's "use strict" and further improved with ES6 modules. Block scoping finally exists thanks to `let`. ES6's module loaders allow translation hooks to enable dialects or alternative languages to be run in-browser (which you can do with preprocessing and build steps and directly, but using them in-language streamlines the "shift-reloadability" development experience). Module loaders also provide a saner eval, which allows you to completely sandbox the evaluated code. Macros could even allow rebinding operators like `==` to have cleaned-up semantics.

What a waste of time it would have been to standardize the pre-PNaCl work, for example.  I wouldn't expect Rust (for example) to be standardized at this point either.<p>&#62; No view source.<p>It's highly unlikely that JavaScript spit out by a code generator (this would be the competition for NaCl) is going to be at all readable.  I'm guessing it will be about as readable as the portable BitCode that comprises the PNaCl image (which you could view if you really want to).<p>It's disappointing to continuously see this anti-NaCl propaganda from Mozilla.  Here you have a promising and highly innovative technology that is pushing the bounds of what is possible on the web.  It's being developed completely in the open with papers and code being published continuously.  Mozilla's mission is "to promote openness, innovation and opportunity on the web."  I just can't see what part of that mission involves campaigning against an open technology that could advance the web and help it compete with native apps.<p>I could understand if their position was "we're reserving judgment until it's portable, stable, and standardized."  I could understand "we want to be more involved in the process."  I could understand "we are waiting to see if it can demonstrate a compelling advantage over JavaScript."  But everything I have heard indicates that they are publicly and completely opposed to ever supporting it, which will make it all the harder for them to ever change their mind on this point without losing face.<p>I grew up watching Mozilla develop from an unstable binary called "apprunner" into a full-featured open-source browser with cutting edge extension capabilities.  I downloaded almost every single  milestone and tried it out, craving the day when I could ditch crappy old Netscape 4 for good.  I got warm fuzzies when the Mozilla Foundation was created; it felt good knowing that there would always be a way to use the web with open source software, and that there would always be an advocate for openness and freedom.  I just never expected to see them fighting against open technology.  It's disappointing.</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_4632410" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4632410&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%30%30%35%37"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_4632410"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=BrendanEich">BrendanEich</a> 849 days ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4632410">link</a><span class="deadmark"></span></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">PNaCl is both not done and (last I checked) not totally machine-independent due to LLVM encodings of machine word sizes. See also <a href="http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/43769" rel="nofollow">http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/43...</a> for doubts on the wisdom of using LLVM bitcode for a long-lived, widely-distributed object file format.<p>PNACL is a fine research project, but unfortunately both NaCl and PNaCl are tied to Pepper, a gargantuan API specified nowhere and implemented only in chromium.org code.<p>To say this is "Open Technology" is to reduce "Open" to the level of "Big company Big Bucks Open-washing." There is nothing open about an unspecified research project without a proven multi-party governance structure that's dominated from start to finish by Google, and which only Google could afford to staff and push -- including via big-money distribution deals with game developers and distributors.<p>As I said at Strange Loop and in past talks, don't shoot the messenger: Microsoft and Apple will never adopt NaCl/Pepper. It is a non-starter as a web standard.<p>Why pray tell should Mozilla fall on Google's sword here? Why should we beg to be involved more "in the process" years after it started? Who are you to say that NaCl/Pepper is <i>better</i> for developers or anyone else than a cross-browser approach targeting JS VMs, which are already there and getting fast enough with typed array memory models to compete with PNaCl? (We aim to demonstrate this.)<p>NaCl/Pepper looks like an incumbent power's technological folly, similar to Microsoft Active X or Google's Dart-as-a-native-VM. Just because a big company can pay for it does not make it "Open" or "Good" or good for the web.<p>You've been free with charges of dishonesty, but I'll refrain from drawing conclusions about you from your position except to say that what you write is astoundingly naive -- at best. For anyone building a competitive browser that is not Chrome or chromium-based, what you propose is a money pit in direct and opportunity costs, with no clear path to standardization, where Firefox would always be behind in "Pepper conformance" compared to Chrome. The answer is no.<p>You'll get the same answer from any other browser vendor not free-riding off of chromium/Google.</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="80"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_4632962" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4632962&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%30%30%35%37"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_4632962"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=haberman">haberman</a> 849 days ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4632962">link</a><span class="deadmark"></span></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">There is a wide gap between fully embracing a technology and spreading misinformation about it.  I respect Mozilla's decision not to integrate NaCl, to argue that it's premature to talk about doing so while it's underspecified and coupled to Chromium, and to set criteria that it must meet before it will be on the table for further discussion.  I can understand concerns about cost and governance and an unwillingness to jump on what is perceived as a "Google treadmill."  None of my comment was about any of that.<p>What I can't understand is the fundamentalist reaction to the very idea of native code, the ignoring/dismissing of serious work to solve the problem of portability, the liberal use of words like "never" and "non-starter," spread of FUD by invoking inaccurate comparisons like ActiveX (vis a vis its security model) and DLL Hell, and the spreading of misinformation.  For example, PNaCl is not, and as far as I can tell never has been, dependent on machine word size.  The link you cited doesn't apply because it is arguing against a different approach than what PNaCl actually does.<p>PNaCl works by defining a little-endian ILP32 machine as the target and fixing all important characteristics of this machine independently of the characteristics of the underlying CPU.  This abstract machine's characteristics are defined in such a way that they can efficiently be translated to native code on any modern CPU.  This is all covered in the introductory doc: <a href="http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/native_client/data/site/pnacl.pdf?revision=1752" rel="nofollow">http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/native_client/data/site/pnacl...</a><p>&#62; a cross-browser approach targeting JS VMs, which are already there and getting fast enough with typed array memory models to compete with PNaCl? (We aim to demonstrate this.)<p>This is a far more reasonable and compelling story.  By all means talk up your stuff and argue that you can win in the free market of ideas.  I'm not arguing that I or anybody else should be able to dictate to developers what technology they use; on the contrary it is the Mozilla argument of "no one gets to the machine except through our VM and our GC" that paternalistically ties developers' hands and limits their options.</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="120"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_4633359" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4633359&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%30%30%35%37"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_4633359"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=BrendanEich">BrendanEich</a> 849 days ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4633359">link</a><span class="deadmark"></span></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">You are still being free with accusations of spreading misinformation and other evils. If you want to have a real exchange, cool it! Just try to imagine how a hardball from me casting aspersions on you for suspected bad or unfair (to Mozilla; "fair" to Google) motives might feel.<p>Thanks for the PNaCl pointer. My comment was based on LLVM bitcode having machine word size dependencies. This was an issue a while ago. I should have checked to see if it remained one.<p>This correction doesn't alter the general unreadiness of PNaCl for the web, on several fronts. Pepper is one, but PNaCl performance lagging NaCl is another. The Chrome Web Store features games ported via NaCl, for performance -- not PNaCl, which would be significantly slower. On this basis alone, it's premature for you to push PNaCl ahead of Google.<p>&#62; This is a far more reasonable and compelling story.<p>Well, gee, thanks a ton! :-|<p>I've been telling this story clearly since Fluent in May. That you chose not to hear it and instead flung accusations and told sob-stories about big bad Mozilla is your doing, not mine.<p>Here's a final clue: <i>all</i> browser vendors, definitely including Chrome, make the rule (not an argument) "no one gets to the machine except through our VM(s) and GC(s)" -- outside of a few dying plugins, which are even source-licensed and co-released.<p>And that brings back my final point: NaCl is for safer plugins, which are OS-specific anyway. The likeliest evolution of SFI or CFI enforcing compilers and runtimes as plugin hosts is via the OS, not the browser.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Thanks for the support, but that's not what I meant. NaCl + Pepper is like a VM where the compiler does the heavy lifting so the native code can run safely (Software Fault Isolation, SFI -- wild pointers lead to a safe non-exploitable crash), rather than a JITting or MMU- or hypervisor-based VM doing the heavy lifting at runtime.<p>It's quite clever, but still enough of a new thing that Chrome <i>also</i> sandboxes NaCl'ed code out of process. Belt and braces are good. No silver bullets.<p>But a VM is as a VM does. This is part of Google's VM-set and not any other browsers. The rule still applies.<p>Truly unsafe native code in plugins (e.g., un-NaCl'ed Flash) runs out of process too, and sandboxed to some extent, but it can cause problems that are not contained (and did at the last CanSecWest Pwn2Own contest, IIRC).</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="240"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_4634172" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4634172&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%30%30%35%37"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_4634172"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=haberman">haberman</a> 849 days ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4634172">link</a><span class="deadmark"></span></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">In reverse order:<p>* Why in the OS? I didn't say "belong", just "likelier". That is because plugins are native code compiled by OS-dependent toolchains, and OS vendors are few (three that matter) and lock up native code these days via SDK licenses, app store rules, and even kernel-level restrictions.<p>In contrast, there are four or five competitive browsers, only one of which has Pepper and the rest do not -- and will not.<p>* I do not know how much better PNaCl can get. The shallow argument here is your assertion that "you know it'll get better". The same could be speculated about JS performance at Emscripten-generated code, and that works cross-browser. That's the cross-browser path of least resistance, compared to the practically unpassable Pepper barrier.<p>* Pepper is "inspired" by lots of APIs, but here the shallow shoe fits your new-HN-user drive-by. NPAPI is a sunk cost all browsers save modern IE have paid out for years. Pepper is new and much bigger. Have you even read all the interfaces?<p>The bottom line is that whatever PNaCl performance wins may lie in the future -- and I will believe them when Google does as shown by Chrome Web Store games being PNaCl'ed not NaCl'ed -- Pepper is the blocker for any cross-browser adoption in reality.<p>This ignores principled objections to more native code on the web, as a "social ill". Let's take that up separately, because it could override any technical argument. I'm happy to stop on the Pepper point for now, since Google manifestly is stuck there.</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="240"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_4633787" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4633787&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%30%30%35%37"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_4633787"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=aplzrtve">aplzrtve</a> 849 days ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4633787">link</a><span class="deadmark"></span></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">The slide I showed is not misleading. NaCl is not portable, PNaCl is still not ready for prime time based on Google's own actions, and you protest too much and do not practice what you preach.<p>"Mozilla" meaning me, bzbarsky, blizzard (previously), roc on the plugin-futures list, others have been forthright compared to the mostly-silent other browser vendors, who haven't even spoken via corporate or individual channels on this non-issue apart from my pal Maciej at Apple coining "Active G" to refer to Pepper.<p>If this circumstance makes you shoot us, the messengers, you need to read more Greek tragedy!<p>We're telling you why NaCl/Pepper are a no-sale among all the non-chromium browsers. You don't like the reasons we give, but that's no justification for your ascribing to us bad motives or a dishonest agenda or techniques ("propaganda"). We have been perfectly clear about the unacceptably high cost of Pepper, and the single-company control problem of all of NaCl/PNaCl/Pepper.<p>Your own misstatements are yours, and you should retract or not based on their righteous or wrongful nature, not on what anyone else does. That you excuse your conduct based on your grievance with us is thoroughly broken, as a piece of moral reasoning.<p>At this point you are perfectly clear: you want a free lunch (from all browsers, but especially from Firefox), we won't give it to you, so you call us names and imply that we act out of bad motives.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">&#62; At this point you are perfectly clear: you want a free lunch<p>Nope, I wanted a footnote that says "they're working on it."  That is about 97% of what I wanted from this discussion.  ES6 isn't "ready for prime time" either, being an unfinished spec, and yet the entire presentation was about that.  You're comparing JavaScript's future with NaCl's present, and not mentioning that it is Google's stated purpose to remove the glaring limitation that is the basis of your discounting it as a technology (at least as far as that slide is concerned).  How is that not misleading?<p>I have never once suggested, in a single one of my messages on this thread, that non-Chromium browsers should adopt NaCl/Pepper in their current form (in fact I have said exactly the opposite, that I can understand their reasons for not wanting to), and yet you continue to attribute this viewpoint to me, calling me "astoundingly naive" for it, and issuing no retraction for that (despite all the retractions you demand from me).  How is this the moral high ground?<p>I would be happy (more than happy, actually) to completely retract my statement, since it certainly gives me no pleasure to think that you would mislead your audience, but you are declining to demonstrate that I <i>was</i> wrong or that you have an interest in being entirely forthcoming with your audience.  By pressuring me to retract my statements while feeling free to say what you want I feel you are bullying me.  I'm not a huge fan of how you are ascribing inaccurate viewpoints to me and calling me names for them, and yet I am not demanding that you retract it all or I will discount your existence as a person (incredibly harsh, by the way).</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="320"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_4635663" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4635663&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%30%30%35%37"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_4635663"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=othermaciej">othermaciej</a> 849 days ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4635663">link</a><span class="deadmark"></span></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Wow, I didn't notice that the thread continued for so long after I posted.<p>The things you cite are pretty much all because I would never give 0% probability to a future event. Who knows? Things change. But I think it is quite unlikely that NaCl will become a widely accepted part of the Web platform, and I think that would be a bad thing in its current state.<p>My "highly pragmatic and specific" criticisms seem to me like they say the same thing as Brendan's original slide bullets, just with more detail. I did not mention "no view source", but I agree that is a significant downside, if not necessarily as much of a showstopper as the others. Being a single-vendor-controlled technology is the biggest showstopper.<p>Another big issue that I didn't mention, and which I think also aligns with Brendan's criticisms, is that adding a major new technology to the web platform requires tremendously compelling use cases and a good argument that they cannot be handled with existing technologies. I don't think that case has really been made for NaCl.<p>And yes, I did jokingly coin the term "ActiveG" to refer to NaCl. Though I believe it was another wag who later referred to Dart as "GBScript".</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="520"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_4731743" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4731743&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%30%30%35%37"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_4731743"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=haberman">haberman</a> 826 days ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4731743">link</a><span class="deadmark"></span></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Oh hey, I just saw this now.<p>For what it's worth I thought you were from Mozilla when I wrote my post, not that it matters that much either way.<p>I think you made some substantial points that were not covered in Brendan's slides, specifically:<p>- A standard with only one implementation is de facto controlled by one entity.  This is a great point, and different than Brendan's point  "defined by implementation."  Brendan's criticism would be solved simply by standardizing (P)NaCl under multi-party governance, which I fully expect Google will do at some point.  [0]  Your criticism is not solved unless it is actually practically feasible for someone else to implement that standard.<p>- Relying on binary-level validation of binary code has a lot of attack surface.  This is a great point that I've seen others make, though I believe it is being addressed (perhaps since you wrote your message) by having multiple layers of defense (ie. also running in a separate process inside a ptrace sandbox).<p>It doesn't bother me that you joke around with your friends by calling it "ActiveG," because in the context of serious discussion you acknowledge that it has "a better attempt at security design than ActiveX."  It does bother me when others seriously compare the two, as if a completely unsandboxed execution environment can be compared to a serious attempt at sandboxing.<p>In any case, now that it supposed to be shipping soon (<a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-57534803-93/google-offers-low-budget-arm-based-chromebook/" rel="nofollow">http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-57534803-93/google-offers-l...</a>) we should get a better chance to see if it truly can demonstrate a compelling improvement over JavaScript.<p>[0] Just wanted to mention that though I work for Google I am not involved in (P)NaCl and have no inside information about it.</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="480"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_4650379" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4650379&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%30%30%35%37"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_4650379"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=BrendanEich">BrendanEich</a> 845 days ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4650379">link</a><span class="deadmark"></span></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">The purpose of my "final-sounding judgments" is to cut the crap in the short term that keeps getting dumped on Mozilla by you and others with an enlarged sense of entitlement, and an unjustified assumption that NaCl/PNaCl + Pepper is somehow "better" in the large, and so should get free support from non-Chrome browsers.<p>If you think overcoming some hurdles enumerated by Maciej will get PNaCL and Pepper support into Safari (where, BTW, Pepper is closest to porting cleanly by any measure, e.g., patch size), you're dreaming. Remember, I did not coin the funny "Active G" phrase. That shoe was fit by the guy you're trying to suck up to here.<p>If an indefinite-future-tense, and therefore worthless, promise from me to be open to portable SuperPNaCl in 2020, will get you to stop bashing Mozilla and flattering Apple, then here it is. Indeed my plan is for JS to evolve and mutate to be that portable object format for native code to compile to.<p>Emscripten is a promising sign along this path. And the PNaCl folks are targeting JS too, I hear, so this looks like a common goal.<p>Now can you stop defaming Mozilla?<p>/be</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="520"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_4650646" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4650646&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%30%30%35%37"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_4650646"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=askimto">askimto</a> 845 days ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4650646">link</a><span class="deadmark"></span></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">I always reply when I have something worth saying.<p>"Hate" is the wrong word. There's nothing to hate in a well-done SFI-enforcing compiler. I admire the R&#38;D effort. We -- bad old Mozilla, including evil-me -- are seriously considering using NaCl (not Pepper) for SFI in native code parts of Servo. No "hate" here, so do try to grow up: "You hate NaCl" is just weak, beneath you, as an analysis of motives and causes.<p>Let's step away from NaCl as pure tech for safer compilation of unsafe languages.<p>I do call Google's business strategy pushing NaCl+Pepper via games and even (till it all fell apart last November) Flash heavy-handed, and one-sided to such an extent that what's pushed can never be standardized.<p>What's belligerent here is for someone (haberman), who I hear works for Google, a company that has all the money and power in the world, and which makes actual "pro-NaCl propaganda" as well as pays game developers and others to use the Chrome-only tech (NaCl, not PNaCl, note well), to fire first on this thread. It wasn't me who showed "belligerence".<p>That first shot even tried open-washing, lamely, and it tellingly put Mozilla in the subordinate position. ''I could understand "we want to be more involved in the process."''<p>If you don't work for Google or hold a brief for them, ask yourself why haberman's presumption is that Mozilla, or any other browser maker, should be asking or begging to be included in a process that we were excluded from and practically speaking could never participate in without equal big bucks and market power.<p>The great thing about the Web is that no one owns it. Browser vendors, tool makers, and developers (whom the first two groups avidly court) have to reach consensus via standards. And I find that developers, not just pure web devs, definitely including @kripken (Emscripten's creator), @jashkenas (CoffeeScript), and others, are more creative and faster moving than many highly-paid C++-first hackers, including those perpetrating single-vendor follies such as NaCl+Pepper.<p>Whine at me, cry "hate" and "belligerence" while turning a blind eye to the big gun who fired first, and shoot the messenger. It doesn't matter. NaCl+Pepper have already lost to JS for portable cross-browser high-performance native code compilation.</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="600"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_4651974" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4651974&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%30%30%35%37"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_4651974"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=gunsmith">gunsmith</a> 844 days ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4651974">link</a><span class="deadmark"></span></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">You're doing better! But no, I don't "hate" Google. Big companies and big groups of people in general have inherent morally failure-prone properties. Google fights these, and in many ways still manages "don't be evil".<p>Heavy-handed and one-sided strategies and tactics may be odious, I may "hate" them -- you should too if they're not well-justified and likely to prevail -- but that's not the point of this exchange, which haberman started. Nice try deflecting, though.<p>The point of my slide, and of my comments here, is to make the case for what's best for the Web. So let's get back to that.<p>What is best for the Web? Not NaCl, we all agree. PNaCl? Not with Pepper as a mandatory API for all browsers to adopt. And PNaCl has a JS back end.<p>Steve Jobs killed Flash. Plugins are in decline. However well Google, Mozilla, and others use NaCl for native code safety, on the Web JS looks highly likely to continue, and to get super-fast for the well-typed and GC-free code produced by Emscripten.<p>This all points to a future where evolved JS is the PNaCl format that works cross-browser. We're already working on this at Mozilla, but via Emscripten not PNaCl. If Google aims its formidable engineers at the same goal and works in the standards bodies early and fairly, great.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">&#62; and released by a company with a history of
&#62; "embrace, extend, extinguish."<p>It's worth considering technology on its merits, not just based on past behavior of companies.  In recent years, Microsoft has been much more of a team player in the web space than Google has, for what it's worth.<p>That said, I didn't claim NaCL was in all respects identical to Silverlight.  I said it was comparable.  It's more open in some ways (open source), less in others (e.g. no independent reimplementations, and precious little chance of any as things stand).  The provenance is equally unpalatable, from my point of view; Google may not be aiming for "extinguish", not least because that's not very likely with the web at this point, but it's certainly aiming for "embrace, extend, coopt", which is not much better.<p>&#62; That someone who appears to be speaking for Mozilla<p>In general, people who work on Mozilla speak for themselves.  The cases when they're speaking for "Mozilla" are very rare and always marked as such.  In this instance, I'm speaking for myself.<p>&#62; This claim is directly at odds with the public statements
&#62; of Mozilla's Chris Blizzard<p>Chris and I don't always agree on everything.  But some of his arguments are certainly valid.  I didn't say I'd adopt PNaCl with open arms; just that the discussion should be revisited.

They can take the scary images, if those images truly are scary.<p>BTW, Chris Blizzard works for Facebook now.<p>Back to more serious topics...<p>UPDATE: to be fair to blizzard, he was objecting (as bz reminds me) on behalf of Mozilla to paving the web with x86 or other machine-dependent code, however compiled. Mozilla still opposes more such machine-specific plugin code. Think of NaCl as a safer plugin compiler, nothing more.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">A lot of people say they want a bytecode for the web. The problem is, bytecode vs text is just an encoding issue, and it's practically insignificant. It's a platform either way, and the real issues are what services the platform will provide.<p>For example, NaCl doesn't provide Garbage Collection (GC) last I checked. Applications can link in GC libraries for themselves, however that's more code for clients to download, and it may mean that the GC can't do all the low-level things that modern GCs do to get good performance. Is this an acceptable tradeoff for the web? I believe questions like this one are the important ones.</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="120"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_4631727" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4631727&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%30%30%35%37"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_4631727"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=MatthewPhillips">MatthewPhillips</a> 850 days ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4631727">link</a><span class="deadmark"></span></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Languages targeting bytcode platforms are just as liable to be second-class citizens as ones targeting JavaScript.<p>Scala and Clojure don't support proper tail calls. Why? Because the JVM is the <i>Java</i> Virtual Machine! I believe there were similar issue for dynamic languages on the JVM for the longest time as well.<p>And now just imagine implementing a Haskell-&#62;JVM compiler. I wouldn't be surprised if that's actually <i>more</i> difficult than implementing a Haskell-&#62;JavaScript compiler.<p>So yes: with JavaScript as the target, other languages are second-class citizens. But with some bytecode, that won't probably won't change much. Knowing how these things get designed, the end result could easily be that <i>every</i> language including JavaScript becomes a second-class citizen.</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="80"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_4631157" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4631157&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%30%30%35%37"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_4631157"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=bgarbiak">bgarbiak</a> 850 days ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4631157">link</a><span class="deadmark"></span></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">"proprietary" is a spectrum, not a binary decision.<p>You can be open-source, documented (though NaCl is not so documented in practice because of the Pepper dependencies), published, and encouraged to adopt, but if your development is controlled completely by a single company and if you depend on other, undocumented, parts of that company's software stack, then you are more proprietary than something with an open (as in, developed in the open, with many participants) standard and no dependencies on a particular implementation.<p>Obviously you'd be less proprietary than, say, ActiveX, but that's a pretty low bar nowadays.  NaCl is not competing against ActiveX; it's competing against the web platform as it exists.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Sigh.  Not all open source projects are community projects.  That doesn't make them proprietary.  I'm disappointed to see this kind of confusion on HN.<p>Rust doesn't have much of a community around it, besides Mozilla.  Does that make it "proprietary"?  Nope.<p>We all know NaCl is not going to be adopted-- not because it's not good enough, but because it's too good, and would threaten the native app ecosystems of Apple and Microsoft.  pNaCl, same story.  Google might end up using it as an app delivery mechanism in ChromeOS; that's about the limit of its potential usefulness.<p>It's particularly ironic to hear Brendan Eich complain about the lack of a standards-first approach in NaCl, since ECMAScript was designed behind closed doors at a single company.  Anyway, ECMAScript seems to be good enough for building web UIs, and it's even a little less verbose than its "older brother" (whom it resembles not at all).  So I think its quasi-monopoly is secure.  I hope they pull the TypeScript extensions into the core language in the next version.</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="200"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_4634957" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4634957&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%30%30%35%37"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_4634957"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=BrendanEich">BrendanEich</a> 849 days ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4634957">link</a><span class="deadmark"></span></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">According to the Apache project, a project is "considered to have a diverse community when it is not highly dependent on any single contributor (there are at least 3 legally independent committers and there is no single company or entity that is vital to the success of the project)."  Rust might meet that standard in the future, but it is not there yet.<p>With regard to JavaScript versus NaCl / PNaCl / etc-- I've heard all the debates before, and they are kind of tedious.  ECMAScript is a good language for some things, but making it the only option is goofy.  I think Mozilla is shooting itself in the foot by not supporting PNaCl, which is the one thing that could potentially save their "boot to Gecko" initiative from disaster.  I guess the Adobe Flash and ActiveX experience left emotional scars that haven't healed yet.  Oh well.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">I think you missed my point.<p>Say you have an open-source project with a single owner, who makes all the decisions about it, and is willing to totally change it around to suit his needs.<p>Would you stake your business on use of that open-source project?  Only to the extent that you're sure your needs align with the project owner's.  Unless, of course, you're planning to fork anyway.<p>That's where NaCl is at the moment.<p>It's also where Rust is, even more than NaCl.  Anyone who is not in the business of working on Servo is nuts if they're relying on Rust for anything important, so far.  In my opinion.  So yes, from my point of view Rust is definitely proprietary to Mozilla at the moment, and asking anyone else to use it (again for anything important, not just experiments) is just a recipe for disaster.<p>As far as NaCl adoption, Apple and Microsoft have their own reasons for not adopting it, for sure.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">There's audio processing stuff that I'd love to do in web browsers, but I refuse to touch Javascript with a ten-foot pole. I am the kind of person that would like NaCl to be adopted outside of Chrome. If you are the kind of person that is more interested in building the "app" part of some application of that kind of program, you have nothing to fear from NaCl -- just think of it as opening up the "standard native code" (native browser code, like video codecs, gzip decompression, etc) part of the web browser to everyone. You don't really care about what's going on under the hood when your users decompress some data you served to them, as long as everything works properly, right? That's pretty much the definition of something that most web developers couldn't care less about, and that people who do (for lack of a better term) "fast computing" care desperately about.<p>To give a recent example, what if you'd like to start serving Opus audio to all your users? The standard response to that idea now is "that's funny, Internet Explorer will never even support <i>Vorbis</i>, and that's over a decade old." If safe native code execution was a standard part of the browser right now, it would be trivial to distribute an Opus decoder alongside the "web app" you implemented in Javascript. Opus would just be your competitive advantage, not something you need to beg people to implement. It would already be ubiquitous.<p>Before anyone mentions X implementation of Y audio codec in Javascript in an attempt to discredit the value of native code execution, just stop. I highly doubt it will work acceptably on my mom's computer (the average computer that accesses your site is almost surely a hell of a lot less powerful than you may assume it is), and I highly doubt you'll ever be able to rival the performance of native code for processing on the order of video codecs anyways. Not to mention the fact that the majority of the nontrivial Javascript audio demos you've heard were made possible in no small part due to standardized, native code linear filtering and convolution.<p>"Frustration" would be the word that sums up the whole "web app" movement to me. When I see that someone's made a client-side GIF animating "web app," all I can think about is how it would have taken two seconds to hook an existing highly performant C GIF encoder up to some Javascript, and instead we had to wait for someone who knows Javascript to hack a painfully slow (and therefore useless for the vast majority of users) alternative together. You know how ubiquitous similar server-side services are? That's because all it takes to make one is a simple Javascript/HTML form (or HTTP, if you want to get trivial)-based interface to an existing C program. Just think of where client side web apps could be right now if the same were true for them.</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="120"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_4631050" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4631050&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%30%30%35%37"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_4631050"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=chipsy">chipsy</a> 850 days ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4631050">link</a><span class="deadmark"></span></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">I've been doing audio processing in Flash for a while (most recently, sample-based synthesis implementing a decent portion of SFZ and SF2, with 64-voice polyphony and filters) and I did have to push an unusual degree of effort into optimizing the sample copying code, with a Haxe macro that generates an optimal inlined loop for each combination of parameters. It can still use up most of a core when maxed out...<p>...however, I did some math and some extrapolation and determined that within the next three to five years this domain will be completely reasonable to approach from JS, driven by a combination of technologies:<p>-access to GPGPU from the browser. DSP work can generally be defined in terms of a shader, although it's still a very poorly understood area.<p>-more general-purpose cores, faster JIT performance, and possibly single-threaded hardware improvements as well. These things compound easily, so we could end up with a 50-100x larger JS performance envelope for this domain without even considering the GPU.<p>-maturation of the existing and planned audio APIs for common tasks. As you point out, this isn't interesting from a "ground-breaking tech" perspective, but in covering typical application needs, it's as important as the others since it's both convenient and optimized out of the box.<p>-maturation of cross-compilation technologies, smoothing over the "code has already been written" issue.<p>In a lot of ways, all JS has to do to be competitive is the "catch-up" work. It takes quite a while in tech time, but in human time, most of us will be around in the next decade.</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="120"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_4631006" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4631006&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%30%30%35%37"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_4631006"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jorangreef">jorangreef</a> 850 days ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4631006">link</a><span class="deadmark"></span></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Yes, my comment was concerning the top-down approach taken by browser vendors, and that web apps need to be empowered with low-level APIs such as TCP and POSIX. I don't think I said or TBL said that we need to ship native code to browsers to do this. We don't. We don't need another language. Javascript is fine. We do need better low-level APIs. We do need to get away from relying on browser vendors to spec and implement everything correctly, because with such a massive surface like they're targeting they won't. We do need to push this responsibility out to the edges. We need to drastically reduce the standard API and move the functionality from high level (as in IndexedDB) to low level (as in POSIX). We need a strong powerful stable small core and OSS must do the rest. That's the general idea. The finer details can be nitpicked and that won't invalidate the general idea. Browser vendors are simply doing way too much.</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="160"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_4631712" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4631712&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%30%30%35%37"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_4631712"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=MatthewPhillips">MatthewPhillips</a> 850 days ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4631712">link</a><span class="deadmark"></span></span></div><br>

The launch of mobile app development changed things. The kinds of apps being delivered were outright better than what equivalent web apps were delivering. Not the perf, I assume perf is going to be solved by better hardware and engine improvements, but what the apps accomplish. My conclusion is that every project has a semi-fixed budget of resources and that web developers burn roughly 50% of that budget on building a custom one-off interface solution for every project they work on. The obvious answer is components but component frameworks had not been catching on so the question is why.<p>The normally cited problem is the composition problem. It's incredibly difficult to achieve component isolation in the DOM and the Web Components effort is attempting to address. I approve the effort but I do not believe it will solve the problem. It's possible(ref yui3) to write components that will cleanly drop into pages that keep their CSS tweaks class based and that restriction isn't unreasonable in an app. Component use happens more frequently in apps but is not the default like it needs to be to escape the one-off tar pit. The issue is social.<p>The web's roots in documents mean that pretty much everybody wants a custom UI. All existing component libraries, following desktop toolit precedents, come as a packaged markup/CSS/behavior combo. These two requirements are opposed and that opposition is the core problem. I have never used a component library and not had to customize a signfiicant number of components. When doing so, I either have to maintain a private fork of the component or suffer in download/perf as the framework is super heavy and caters to all possibilities. The yui3 (and looks like current dojo) approach of core+plugin composition with auto dependency resolution is the best solution I know of but overriding is still non-trivial. Tweaking the CSS usually means having to build a complete theme and using generated markup is hit and miss.<p>My current thinking is that Web Components are a start but there needs to be a good solution for selectively overriding a part of the markup and for overriding style. CSS preprocessor features are also required to achieve styling goals efficiently. The rise of Bootstrap might prove me wrong by starting as an incomplete system, getting buy in (multiple themes, adoption for simple uses), and growing to a more complete one but we'll see.</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="80"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_4630794" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4630794&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%30%30%35%37"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_4630794"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=skyhook_mockups">skyhook_mockups</a> 850 days ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4630794">link</a><span class="deadmark"></span></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">&#62; Is it just me or does the proposed ES6-standard smell of heavy feature creep?<p>I've been on TC39 for years and the vast majority of what we do is cut.<p>&#62; we get classes _and_ modules _and_ typed objects.<p>Classes are syntactic sugar for one of the most common dynamic patterns in JavaScript: object factories. Modules are static collections of code. Very different things, especially in a dynamic language like JS. Typed objects are not even remotely related; they're a low-level API for efficiently working with structured binary data.<p>&#62; same with macros and codegens.<p>As Yehuda says, macros are not part of ES6 but rather an experiment at <a href="http://sweetjs.org" rel="nofollow">http://sweetjs.org</a> to consider for future editions. I don't know what you mean by "codegens." Brendan's slides weren't talking about a feature, but rather an existing usage pattern that we need to serve in additional to human code-writers.<p>ES6 actually does a remarkable job covering many use cases with small modifications that smoothly integrate with the existing language. You might want to try experimenting with some of these features, many of which are implemented partly or completely in SpiderMonkey (as Brendan's latest blog post details). Most of the features are small improvements to paper cuts, and as everyone I've ever spoken to who's written SpiderMonkey-specific JavaScript attests (for example, in the Firefox front-end or in addons), they make your life so much nicer. I'm particularly thinking of let and destructuring, and I suspect parameter defaults and rest-arguments will be hugely popular as well. The few bigger features, especially modules and generators, are for addressing the most important gaps in JS.<p>Dave</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_4630364" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4630364&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%30%30%35%37"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_4630364"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=bcantrill">bcantrill</a> 850 days ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4630364">link</a><span class="deadmark"></span></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Howdy, Bryan. A few comments.<p>First, it's not all about _moi_. As with any mature language with multiple implementations, there is a committee, Ecma TC39. It has reps from all the bigs plus PayPal (Doug Crockford) and Yahoo!. We avoid design by committee, instead focusing on paving the cowpaths and in a few cases working with champions -- single innovators or RPG's "resonant dyads" _a la_ ken&#38;dmr -- to do focused design. The best example in my view is the Proxy design by Mark Miller and Tom Van Cutsem, followed by Modules by Dave Herman and Sam Tobin-Hochstadt.<p>We have a few goals, including minimizing kernel semantics and extending syntax for usability only where we have experience and positive user-testing results (e.g., destructuring, let, generators, classes as prototypal sugar a la CoffeeScript).<p>In this light, we aren't dumping new semantics into ES6. If you count fairly, we are filling the big semantic gaps in ES5 (AKA JS as we know it). For instance, where is client-side synchronous "require" without the ES6 module system? No fair that Node's require is sync (against all sound doctrine!). Sync XHR is from the jank-devil, and we cannot do sync require as an API client side.<p>Second, as others have noted, V8 was stealth'ed for two years (I learned of it in 2006 but Google withheld, see <a href="https://brendaneich.com/2011/06/new-javascript-engine-module-owner/" rel="nofollow">https://brendaneich.com/2011/06/new-javascript-engine-module...</a>) and then unleashed just as Apple and Mozilla got their JIT acts together. At the time some said V8 was 3x faster, but the actual ratio on stupid benchmarks was more like 1.3x at first.<p>V8 is an amazing piece of work, but it did not contribute to the language evolution that my "very brief history" slide diagrammed. It certainly contributed by being the fastest, but until after 2010, that was the extent of its influence, for several specific reasons.<p>For the first few years as open source, V8 foreswore diverging from JavaScriptCore (the first WebKit engine, Apple's fork of KJS from KHTML, which V8 in some ways forked WebKit to replace) on any new ES5 or ES6 proposals, to try to keep on (or get back on, in view of the fork) Apple's good side. Fat chance!<p>Even now, V8 still keeps prototyped ES6 implementations hidden behind a flag. I expect this flag to be lifted before ES6 is ratified.<p>Another thing that hurt: Google has moved V8 to Munich because the Aarhus team wanted to do Dart, Google explicitly chose to invest in Dart over JS, and the no-remote-teammates rule hurt. IMHO the Munich team is quite strong but only ~10 people. This limits its effectiveness compared to Chakra (~60 heads?) and even SpiderMonkey (~12, more with interns).<p>Finally, whoever thinks I disrespect V8 clearly does not listen to my talks. The video will be up, give it a view when it's live if you have time. There is no disrespect from me toward V8 or the team that built it. I do mention it favorably in all talks, including Strange Loop (if my memory serves).<p>Lars Bak did the Strange Loop first night closing keynote, which my insane schedule prevented me from attending. He and I have had no meetings since that one in 2006, although he met with some Mozilla colleagues in 2009. I bear no bad feelings, although Lars did tell a gratuitous whopper around 3:50 in this talk: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2TJYBmDZHI" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2TJYBmDZHI</a> (see my blog cited above for what happened with Mozilla being "offered" V8 in 2006 -- Google reneged). He is the best VM hacker I know of. (Mike Pall is another superhacker of note.)<p>I hope this sheds some light. I respect V8 while noting that, as with anything human, it and the technical/product/open-source/standards politics around it show some significant flaws. That is inevitable.<p>Mozilla has flaws too, but they tend to be different in kind. For example, we do open from the start and try to partner even against long odds (e.g., Tamarin/ES4). I'm not bragging, because I think that can be a mistake. I've learned from V8 and modified Mozilla strategies accordingly.<p>So, hats off to V8!</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="80"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_4634225" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4634225&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%30%30%35%37"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_4634225"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=bcantrill">bcantrill</a> 849 days ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4634225">link</a><span class="deadmark"></span></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Brendan, I appreciate the thoughtful reply.  I think the only reason for my criticism (and the word "disrespectful" was too harsh -- I should have left it at "annoying") was that your last slide ("Always bet on JS") implies (to me, anyway) that JavaScript's high performance is its manifest destiny.  And that, to me, understates the contribution of V8:  the high performance of JavaScript was not a foregone conclusion; it required guts, innovation and hard work.  As for the assertion that a trace-based JIT beat V8 to market, a trace-based JIT also has well-known failings, so it's not a terribly meaningful data point -- other than that it speaks to the aspirations perhaps for a higher performing JavaScript.  But we clearly agree that Lars and team developed a terrific VM in V8, and that V8 was important in the history of JavaScript -- which was my only point.</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="120"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_4634283" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4634283&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%30%30%35%37"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_4634283"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=BrendanEich">BrendanEich</a> 849 days ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4634283">link</a><span class="deadmark"></span></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Never mind TraceMonkey -- the JavaScriptCore kids rallied in 2008 and did SquirrelFish Extreme, which held its own going into late 2008.<p>The chosen measure of these new VMs was a set of benchmarks, SunSpider from Apple and the V8 Benchmarks from Google. While V8 had the best GC and most optimizations, on these suites at least, for about two weeks for TraceMonkey (and longer for SFX), V8 was not that far ahead.<p>You can find the charts via Google still.<p>V8 had the longest lead time, not just working on what was released with Chrome but trying other approaches first, learning from them, and starting over. That's huge and it has paid off well.<p>But I don't agree that any architectural failing of one VM counts more than public, reproducible benchmark scores. Even V8 had to do Crankshaft.<p>Architectures evolve and supersede one another, but the developer and user benefit -- the public benefit -- comes from the competition. V8 was not alone in driving competition.</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_4630409" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4630409&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%30%30%35%37"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_4630409"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=eranation">eranation</a> 850 days ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4630409">link</a><span class="deadmark"></span></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">My jaw dropped on the byte code slides.   Even though probably foolish to expect that the Javascript creator would offer non-Javascript solutions, I would guess that it would be significantly better to compile Javascript/CSS to a more efficient, stable, portable target byte code or source language (Go? Scheme? Postscript?) than to compile languages to Javascript.  For example, when I played with it the Hello World ClojureScript example compiled to a Javascript file of over 100kbytes.  It seems like Go and JIT'ed languages have demonstrated that extremely fast compilation of extremely efficient high level native code is possible.<p>Long-term it seems like it would be significantly better to encode these web language extensions (new CSS/Javascript syntax) as libraries instead of as API/run-time extensions so that each new version of web languages doesn't require all the run-times (Firefox, Chrome, Safari, IE) to adopt it and old run-times to phase out.  The current standards/run-time process doesn't seem to be extremely well-thought out.  Has anyone on these standards communities ever had to actually build or maintain a web application?</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_4635047" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4635047&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%30%30%35%37"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_4635047"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=BrendanEich">BrendanEich</a> 849 days ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4635047">link</a><span class="deadmark"></span></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Surely the fact that NaCl is currently led by Google should not disqualify it from being a potentially valuable contribution to web apps. Most prevalent technologies started in this way, include js. And most started in a much less 'open' way than NaCl. The point surely is not where they originate but rather whether they offer enough distinctive value that they are compelling enough to be adopted more widely and hence become a key part of our ecosystem. Hence the question is, does NaCl have such a compelling value proposition? Evidently, in Brandan's eyes, and those of several of his colleagues, the answer is no. But other people can disagree and hope that the value is sufficient to eventually win over a broader market share. A good example of such a community is those with large code bases in say C, or C++ who would rather port their code than rewrite it all with all the ensuing maintenance problems. Imho NaCl does have something distinctive to offer and I wish the project well.</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_4630195" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4630195&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%30%30%35%37"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_4630195"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=andreyf">andreyf</a> 850 days ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4630195">link</a><span class="deadmark"></span></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">I would expect to hear something like that not from a respected tehnologist but rather from yet another "cool kid". He could just say "JavaScript is awesome" on a single slide and that wouldn't tell much less than what the whole presentation did.<p>&#62; First they said JS couldn't be useful for building rich internet apps<p>Who said it is? Rich - yes. Anything near to match complexity of the desktop apps - never(think Photoshop).<p>&#62; Then they said it couldn't be fast<p>Benchmarks, maybe?<p>&#62; Then it couldn't do multicore/GPU<p>Webworkers are nice, but you can add bindings to all of this stuff for virtually any programming language.<p>&#62; JavaScript's parser does a more efficient job... than the JVM's bytecode verifier.<p>Figures again?<p>&#62; No view source<p>How viewing at minified JS is going to help me? Especially in the light of what he had on his previous slide:<p>function f() {
L0:
    g();
L1:
    if (p)
        goto L0;
    o.m();
    goto L1;
}<p>Good luck "view source" on what he calls "the assembly of the web".<p>Then the screenshots of 3D games that presumably use WebGL - that just doesn't cut it. Just about every game demo I tried out on my previous generation hi-end ATI graphics card had performance issues. And the level of graphics is comparable to what native games had 10 years ago. That's a joke.<p>&#62; Typed arrays<p>Until they add records so that I can declare an array of <i>any</i> type efficiently don't even bring this up.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">&#62; Photoshop is a notorious pig. I know many designers who have already ditched it for in-browser development.<p>The point was not about using Photoshop for design on the web, but rather its complexity.

I use Google Docs casually for quick and simple stuff, but for any serious work - probably not.<p>&#62; I know many designers who have already ditched it for in-browser development<p>I know many people(all of them are extremely bright) who use Linux on the desktop. I use Linux too(I am not implying I am a clever bloke here). Does this mean Linux is winning the OS war? Otherwise this is just argumentum ad populum.

The bogus claims against JS (going back to the "RIA" era, where IBM and Macromedia/Adobe made such arguments) already fell.<p>I apologize if you suspected a troll in me, but I did not imply comparison with Flash. Flash is just another competitor for you. What What I meant by "but you can add bindings to all of this stuff for virtually any programming language." is if use C/C++ or any other language with access to the OS APIs I don't depend on the wits of browser vendors shipping a particular API for me.<p>&#62; And play BananaBread, for crying out loud (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/demos/detail/bananabread" rel="nofollow">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/demos/detail/bananabread</a>). You simply do not know what you are talking about by your next-to-last paragraph.<p>Believe me or not, but this is exactly the game I was referring to. The link was on the HN last week or so. To be more specific, my graphics card is AMD Radeon HD 6970, capable of running Crysis 2, and I was experiencing lags. As for the graphics, have you ever played Half-Life 2? It was released in 2004 and I can't see this game having any better graphics if not worse. Not to mention that Half-Life would have at least 3x higher FPS on my hardware. Could you please clarify on "You simply do not know what you are talking about"?<p>&#62; Yes, typed arrays were ad-hoc (so are many incremental web standards that win). Binary data (arrays and structs, which compose) as proposed in ES6 are not.<p>Ok, it's good to see JS is going in the right direction. And thanks for taking time to responding to my message. I am actually excited about the work you do at Mozilla on Rust, and I'd like to see a language like that to be available on the client side. But I understand that it's not going to happen anytime soon.</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_4634690" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4634690&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%30%30%35%37"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_4634690"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=williamcotton">williamcotton</a> 849 days ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4634690">link</a><span class="deadmark"></span></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Why do we need to make Photoshop in JS?<p>I can't make a printing press in C++, but why would I want to?<p>Photoshop was made during an era where computers were used to make media for physical printing. You would take a picture with an analog camera, digitize it, manipulate it in Photoshop, and then have it ready for print. "Save For Web" is the closest you get to using Photoshop for publishing to the web, and you'd have to admit it's a bit of an afterthought in the whole experience.<p>Software doesn't exist on it's own. It exists in an input and output environment, beyond just mice and monitors. It exists to capture information, manipulate it, and then republish it.<p>In many ways, memegenerator.net does a better job of consuming, manipulating, and publishing content for the web than Photoshop does.<p>Photoshop will probably not go away. There are still printing presses and there are avenues to publish things made with them. Media tends to gain a lot of inertia by the time it gets to the point of being a household name. However, this inertia doesn't really impede some other form of media from gaining it's own momentum. Photoshop is busy being Photoshop, not memegenerator.net.<p>If you ask my opinion, I'd say there is plenty of ground somewhere between memegenerator.net and Photoshop and there is no better language and environment to create these tools than the environment where they will be published: JavaScript running in a web browser.</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="80"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_4635834" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4635834&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%30%30%35%37"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_4635834"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=kombine">kombine</a> 849 days ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4635834">link</a><span class="deadmark"></span></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Fixed that for you ;)<p><pre><code>  - First they said JS was not practical for building 'rich
    internet apps' because of performance issues combined with
    the well known maintainability problem with JS in large
    code bases.
  - Then they said it wasn't currently fast
  - Then they said it hadn't been fixed
  - Then it doesn't do multicore/GPU
  - Right every time
  - My advise: always bet on JS* being behind most other
    languages because it is a slow moving standards based
    language created in a dictatorial fashion by a committee
    and input from a few powerful entities.</code></pre></font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_4633905" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4633905&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%30%30%35%37"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_4633905"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=goggles99">goggles99</a> 849 days ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4633905">link</a><span class="deadmark"></span></span></div><br>
