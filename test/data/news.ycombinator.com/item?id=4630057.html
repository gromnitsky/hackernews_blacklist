<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>&#62; NaCl?  Not portable.<p>To dis NaCl on this basis and not even mention PNaCl is dishonest.  <a href="http://www.chromium.org/nativeclient/pnacl/building-and-testing-portable-native-client" rel="nofollow">http://www.chromium.org/nativeclient/pnacl/building-and-test...</a><p>&#62; Defined by implementation.<p>As it should be, until the implementation settles and it's clear what interfaces should be standardized.  What a waste of time it would have been to standardize the pre-PNaCl work, for example.  I wouldn't expect Rust (for example) to be standardized at this point either.<p>&#62; No view source.<p>It's highly unlikely that JavaScript spit out by a code generator (this would be the competition for NaCl) is going to be at all readable.  I'm guessing it will be about as readable as the portable BitCode that comprises the PNaCl image (which you could view if you really want to).<p>It's disappointing to continuously see this anti-NaCl propaganda from Mozilla.  Here you have a promising and highly innovative technology that is pushing the bounds of what is possible on the web.  It's being developed completely in the open with papers and code being published continuously.  Mozilla's mission is "to promote openness, innovation and opportunity on the web."  I just can't see what part of that mission involves campaigning against an open technology that could advance the web and help it compete with native apps.<p>I could understand if their position was "we're reserving judgment until it's portable, stable, and standardized."  I could understand "we want to be more involved in the process."  I could understand "we are waiting to see if it can demonstrate a compelling advantage over JavaScript."  But everything I have heard indicates that they are publicly and completely opposed to ever supporting it, which will make it all the harder for them to ever change their mind on this point without losing face.<p>I grew up watching Mozilla develop from an unstable binary called "apprunner" into a full-featured open-source browser with cutting edge extension capabilities.  I downloaded almost every single  milestone and tried it out, craving the day when I could ditch crappy old Netscape 4 for good.  I got warm fuzzies when the Mozilla Foundation was created; it felt good knowing that there would always be a way to use the web with open source software, and that there would always be an advocate for openness and freedom.  I just never expected to see them fighting against open technology.  It's disappointing.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_4632410 href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4632410&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%30%30%35%37"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_4632410></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=BrendanEich">BrendanEich</a> 231 days ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4632410">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>PNaCl is both not done and (last I checked) not totally machine-independent due to LLVM encodings of machine word sizes. See also <a href="http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/43769" rel="nofollow">http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/43...</a> for doubts on the wisdom of using LLVM bitcode for a long-lived, widely-distributed object file format.<p>PNACL is a fine research project, but unfortunately both NaCl and PNaCl are tied to Pepper, a gargantuan API specified nowhere and implemented only in chromium.org code.<p>To say this is "Open Technology" is to reduce "Open" to the level of "Big company Big Bucks Open-washing." There is nothing open about an unspecified research project without a proven multi-party governance structure that's dominated from start to finish by Google, and which only Google could afford to staff and push -- including via big-money distribution deals with game developers and distributors.<p>As I said at Strange Loop and in past talks, don't shoot the messenger: Microsoft and Apple will never adopt NaCl/Pepper. It is a non-starter as a web standard.<p>Why pray tell should Mozilla fall on Google's sword here? Why should we beg to be involved more "in the process" years after it started? Who are you to say that NaCl/Pepper is <i>better</i> for developers or anyone else than a cross-browser approach targeting JS VMs, which are already there and getting fast enough with typed array memory models to compete with PNaCl? (We aim to demonstrate this.)<p>NaCl/Pepper looks like an incumbent power's technological folly, similar to Microsoft Active X or Google's Dart-as-a-native-VM. Just because a big company can pay for it does not make it "Open" or "Good" or good for the web.<p>You've been free with charges of dishonesty, but I'll refrain from drawing conclusions about you from your position except to say that what you write is astoundingly naive -- at best. For anyone building a competitive browser that is not Chrome or chromium-based, what you propose is a money pit in direct and opportunity costs, with no clear path to standardization, where Firefox would always be behind in "Pepper conformance" compared to Chrome. The answer is no.<p>You'll get the same answer from any other browser vendor not free-riding off of chromium/Google.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_4632962 href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4632962&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%30%30%35%37"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_4632962></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=haberman">haberman</a> 231 days ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4632962">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>There is a wide gap between fully embracing a technology and spreading misinformation about it.  I respect Mozilla's decision not to integrate NaCl, to argue that it's premature to talk about doing so while it's underspecified and coupled to Chromium, and to set criteria that it must meet before it will be on the table for further discussion.  I can understand concerns about cost and governance and an unwillingness to jump on what is perceived as a "Google treadmill."  None of my comment was about any of that.<p>What I can't understand is the fundamentalist reaction to the very idea of native code, the ignoring/dismissing of serious work to solve the problem of portability, the liberal use of words like "never" and "non-starter," spread of FUD by invoking inaccurate comparisons like ActiveX (vis a vis its security model) and DLL Hell, and the spreading of misinformation.  For example, PNaCl is not, and as far as I can tell never has been, dependent on machine word size.  The link you cited doesn't apply because it is arguing against a different approach than what PNaCl actually does.<p>PNaCl works by defining a little-endian ILP32 machine as the target and fixing all important characteristics of this machine independently of the characteristics of the underlying CPU.  This abstract machine's characteristics are defined in such a way that they can efficiently be translated to native code on any modern CPU.  This is all covered in the introductory doc: <a href="http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/native_client/data/site/pnacl.pdf?revision=1752" rel="nofollow">http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/native_client/data/site/pnacl...</a><p>&#62; a cross-browser approach targeting JS VMs, which are already there and getting fast enough with typed array memory models to compete with PNaCl? (We aim to demonstrate this.)<p>This is a far more reasonable and compelling story.  By all means talk up your stuff and argue that you can win in the free market of ideas.  I'm not arguing that I or anybody else should be able to dictate to developers what technology they use; on the contrary it is the Mozilla argument of "no one gets to the machine except through our VM and our GC" that paternalistically ties developers' hands and limits their options.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_4633359 href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4633359&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%30%30%35%37"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_4633359></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=BrendanEich">BrendanEich</a> 231 days ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4633359">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>You are still being free with accusations of spreading misinformation and other evils. If you want to have a real exchange, cool it! Just try to imagine how a hardball from me casting aspersions on you for suspected bad or unfair (to Mozilla; "fair" to Google) motives might feel.<p>Thanks for the PNaCl pointer. My comment was based on LLVM bitcode having machine word size dependencies. This was an issue a while ago. I should have checked to see if it remained one.<p>This correction doesn't alter the general unreadiness of PNaCl for the web, on several fronts. Pepper is one, but PNaCl performance lagging NaCl is another. The Chrome Web Store features games ported via NaCl, for performance -- not PNaCl, which would be significantly slower. On this basis alone, it's premature for you to push PNaCl ahead of Google.<p>&#62; This is a far more reasonable and compelling story.<p>Well, gee, thanks a ton! :-|<p>I've been telling this story clearly since Fluent in May. That you chose not to hear it and instead flung accusations and told sob-stories about big bad Mozilla is your doing, not mine.<p>Here's a final clue: <i>all</i> browser vendors, definitely including Chrome, make the rule (not an argument) "no one gets to the machine except through our VM(s) and GC(s)" -- outside of a few dying plugins, which are even source-licensed and co-released.<p>And that brings back my final point: NaCl is for safer plugins, which are OS-specific anyway. The likeliest evolution of SFI or CFI enforcing compilers and runtimes as plugin hosts is via the OS, not the browser.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Thanks for the support, but that's not what I meant. NaCl + Pepper is like a VM where the compiler does the heavy lifting so the native code can run safely (Software Fault Isolation, SFI -- wild pointers lead to a safe non-exploitable crash), rather than a JITting or MMU- or hypervisor-based VM doing the heavy lifting at runtime.<p>It's quite clever, but still enough of a new thing that Chrome <i>also</i> sandboxes NaCl'ed code out of process. Belt and braces are good. No silver bullets.<p>But a VM is as a VM does. This is part of Google's VM-set and not any other browsers. The rule still applies.<p>Truly unsafe native code in plugins (e.g., un-NaCl'ed Flash) runs out of process too, and sandboxed to some extent, but it can cause problems that are not contained (and did at the last CanSecWest Pwn2Own contest, IIRC).</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=240></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_4634172 href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4634172&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%30%30%35%37"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_4634172></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=haberman">haberman</a> 231 days ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4634172">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>In reverse order:<p>* Why in the OS? I didn't say "belong", just "likelier". That is because plugins are native code compiled by OS-dependent toolchains, and OS vendors are few (three that matter) and lock up native code these days via SDK licenses, app store rules, and even kernel-level restrictions.<p>In contrast, there are four or five competitive browsers, only one of which has Pepper and the rest do not -- and will not.<p>* I do not know how much better PNaCl can get. The shallow argument here is your assertion that "you know it'll get better". The same could be speculated about JS performance at Emscripten-generated code, and that works cross-browser. That's the cross-browser path of least resistance, compared to the practically unpassable Pepper barrier.<p>* Pepper is "inspired" by lots of APIs, but here the shallow shoe fits your new-HN-user drive-by. NPAPI is a sunk cost all browsers save modern IE have paid out for years. Pepper is new and much bigger. Have you even read all the interfaces?<p>The bottom line is that whatever PNaCl performance wins may lie in the future -- and I will believe them when Google does as shown by Chrome Web Store games being PNaCl'ed not NaCl'ed -- Pepper is the blocker for any cross-browser adoption in reality.<p>This ignores principled objections to more native code on the web, as a "social ill". Let's take that up separately, because it could override any technical argument. I'm happy to stop on the Pepper point for now, since Google manifestly is stuck there.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=240></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_4633787 href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4633787&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%30%30%35%37"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_4633787></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=aplzrtve">aplzrtve</a> 231 days ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4633787">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Why differentiate plugins? What makes a VM with JIT not a plugin save the browser vendor shipping it with the browser?<p>Why wouldn't other browsers have Pepper?<p>Compilers are as good as what they've been tuned for. In my view PNaCl's shortcoming is startup time because it lacks a JIT and LLVM's back end is too slow for now. Speed up the backend or JIT code and you'll get close to GCC performance while being portable and somewhat language agnostic.<p>Yes I have seen pepper, and most of the interface relates to the GPU.

You're comparing JavaScript's future with NaCl's present, and not mentioning that it is Google's stated purpose to remove the glaring limitation that is the basis of your discounting it as a technology (at least as far as that slide is concerned).  How is that not misleading?<p>I have never once suggested, in a single one of my messages on this thread, that non-Chromium browsers should adopt NaCl/Pepper in their current form (in fact I have said exactly the opposite, that I can understand their reasons for not wanting to), and yet you continue to attribute this viewpoint to me, calling me "astoundingly naive" for it, and issuing no retraction for that (despite all the retractions you demand from me).  How is this the moral high ground?<p>I would be happy (more than happy, actually) to completely retract my statement, since it certainly gives me no pleasure to think that you would mislead your audience, but you are declining to demonstrate that I <i>was</i> wrong or that you have an interest in being entirely forthcoming with your audience.  By pressuring me to retract my statements while feeling free to say what you want I feel you are bullying me.  I'm not a huge fan of how you are ascribing inaccurate viewpoints to me and calling me names for them, and yet I am not demanding that you retract it all or I will discount your existence as a person (incredibly harsh, by the way).</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=320></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_4635663 href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4635663&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%30%30%35%37"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_4635663></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=othermaciej">othermaciej</a> 230 days ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4635663">link</a></span></div><br>

But I think it is quite unlikely that NaCl will become a widely accepted part of the Web platform, and I think that would be a bad thing in its current state.<p>My "highly pragmatic and specific" criticisms seem to me like they say the same thing as Brendan's original slide bullets, just with more detail. I did not mention "no view source", but I agree that is a significant downside, if not necessarily as much of a showstopper as the others. Being a single-vendor-controlled technology is the biggest showstopper.<p>Another big issue that I didn't mention, and which I think also aligns with Brendan's criticisms, is that adding a major new technology to the web platform requires tremendously compelling use cases and a good argument that they cannot be handled with existing technologies. I don't think that case has really been made for NaCl.<p>And yes, I did jokingly coin the term "ActiveG" to refer to NaCl.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Oh hey, I just saw this now.<p>For what it's worth I thought you were from Mozilla when I wrote my post, not that it matters that much either way.<p>I think you made some substantial points that were not covered in Brendan's slides, specifically:<p>- A standard with only one implementation is de facto controlled by one entity.  This is a great point, and different than Brendan's point  "defined by implementation."  Brendan's criticism would be solved simply by standardizing (P)NaCl under multi-party governance, which I fully expect Google will do at some point.  [0]  Your criticism is not solved unless it is actually practically feasible for someone else to implement that standard.<p>- Relying on binary-level validation of binary code has a lot of attack surface.  This is a great point that I've seen others make, though I believe it is being addressed (perhaps since you wrote your message) by having multiple layers of defense (ie. also running in a separate process inside a ptrace sandbox).<p>It doesn't bother me that you joke around with your friends by calling it "ActiveG," because in the context of serious discussion you acknowledge that it has "a better attempt at security design than ActiveX."  It does bother me when others seriously compare the two, as if a completely unsandboxed execution environment can be compared to a serious attempt at sandboxing.<p>In any case, now that it supposed to be shipping soon (<a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-57534803-93/google-offers-low-budget-arm-based-chromebook/" rel="nofollow">http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-57534803-93/google-offers-l...</a>) we should get a better chance to see if it truly can demonstrate a compelling improvement over JavaScript.<p>[0] Just wanted to mention that though I work for Google I am not involved in (P)NaCl and have no inside information about it.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=480></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_4650379 href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4650379&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%30%30%35%37"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_4650379></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=BrendanEich">BrendanEich</a> 226 days ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4650379">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>The purpose of my "final-sounding judgments" is to cut the crap in the short term that keeps getting dumped on Mozilla by you and others with an enlarged sense of entitlement, and an unjustified assumption that NaCl/PNaCl + Pepper is somehow "better" in the large, and so should get free support from non-Chrome browsers.<p>If you think overcoming some hurdles enumerated by Maciej will get PNaCL and Pepper support into Safari (where, BTW, Pepper is closest to porting cleanly by any measure, e.g., patch size), you're dreaming.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I always reply when I have something worth saying.<p>"Hate" is the wrong word. There's nothing to hate in a well-done SFI-enforcing compiler. I admire the R&#38;D effort. We -- bad old Mozilla, including evil-me -- are seriously considering using NaCl (not Pepper) for SFI in native code parts of Servo. No "hate" here, so do try to grow up: "You hate NaCl" is just weak, beneath you, as an analysis of motives and causes.<p>Let's step away from NaCl as pure tech for safer compilation of unsafe languages.<p>I do call Google's business strategy pushing NaCl+Pepper via games and even (till it all fell apart last November) Flash heavy-handed, and one-sided to such an extent that what's pushed can never be standardized.<p>What's belligerent here is for someone (haberman), who I hear works for Google, a company that has all the money and power in the world, and which makes actual "pro-NaCl propaganda" as well as pays game developers and others to use the Chrome-only tech (NaCl, not PNaCl, note well), to fire first on this thread. It wasn't me who showed "belligerence".<p>That first shot even tried open-washing, lamely, and it tellingly put Mozilla in the subordinate position. ''I could understand "we want to be more involved in the process."''<p>If you don't work for Google or hold a brief for them, ask yourself why haberman's presumption is that Mozilla, or any other browser maker, should be asking or begging to be included in a process that we were excluded from and practically speaking could never participate in without equal big bucks and market power.<p>The great thing about the Web is that no one owns it. Browser vendors, tool makers, and developers (whom the first two groups avidly court) have to reach consensus via standards. And I find that developers, not just pure web devs, definitely including @kripken (Emscripten's creator), @jashkenas (CoffeeScript), and others, are more creative and faster moving than many highly-paid C++-first hackers, including those perpetrating single-vendor follies such as NaCl+Pepper.<p>Whine at me, cry "hate" and "belligerence" while turning a blind eye to the big gun who fired first, and shoot the messenger. It doesn't matter. NaCl+Pepper have already lost to JS for portable cross-browser high-performance native code compilation.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=600></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_4650741 href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4650741&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%30%30%35%37"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_4650741></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=askimto">askimto</a> 226 days ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4650741">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>You're doing better! But no, I don't "hate" Google. Big companies and big groups of people in general have inherent morally failure-prone properties. Google fights these, and in many ways still manages "don't be evil".<p>Heavy-handed and one-sided strategies and tactics may be odious, I may "hate" them -- you should too if they're not well-justified and likely to prevail -- but that's not the point of this exchange, which haberman started. Nice try deflecting, though.<p>The point of my slide, and of my comments here, is to make the case for what's best for the Web. So let's get back to that.<p>What is best for the Web? Not NaCl, we all agree. PNaCl? Not with Pepper as a mandatory API for all browsers to adopt. And PNaCl has a JS back end.<p>Steve Jobs killed Flash. Plugins are in decline. However well Google, Mozilla, and others use NaCl for native code safety, on the Web JS looks highly likely to continue, and to get super-fast for the well-typed and GC-free code produced by Emscripten.<p>This all points to a future where evolved JS is the PNaCl format that works cross-browser. We're already working on this at Mozilla, but via Emscripten not PNaCl. If Google aims its formidable engineers at the same goal and works in the standards bodies early and fairly, great.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Sigh.  Not all open source projects are community projects.  That doesn't make them proprietary.  I'm disappointed to see this kind of confusion on HN.<p>Rust doesn't have much of a community around it, besides Mozilla.  Does that make it "proprietary"?  Nope.<p>We all know NaCl is not going to be adopted-- not because it's not good enough, but because it's too good, and would threaten the native app ecosystems of Apple and Microsoft.  pNaCl, same story.  Google might end up using it as an app delivery mechanism in ChromeOS; that's about the limit of its potential usefulness.<p>It's particularly ironic to hear Brendan Eich complain about the lack of a standards-first approach in NaCl, since ECMAScript was designed behind closed doors at a single company.  Anyway, ECMAScript seems to be good enough for building web UIs, and it's even a little less verbose than its "older brother" (whom it resembles not at all).  So I think its quasi-monopoly is secure.  I hope they pull the TypeScript extensions into the core language in the next version.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=200></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_4635054 href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4635054&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%30%30%35%37"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_4635054></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=bzbarsky">bzbarsky</a> 230 days ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4635054">link</a></span></div><br>

We believe the Web should not need plugins to fill decade-long gaps from the '90s that real "coopetition" among browsers in standards bodies can fill much sooner, without the problems that plugins bring.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_4633382 href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4633382&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%30%30%35%37"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_4633382></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=chrisblizzard">chrisblizzard</a> 231 days ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4633382">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>There's audio processing stuff that I'd love to do in web browsers, but I refuse to touch Javascript with a ten-foot pole. I am the kind of person that would like NaCl to be adopted outside of Chrome. If you are the kind of person that is more interested in building the "app" part of some application of that kind of program, you have nothing to fear from NaCl -- just think of it as opening up the "standard native code" (native browser code, like video codecs, gzip decompression, etc) part of the web browser to everyone. You don't really care about what's going on under the hood when your users decompress some data you served to them, as long as everything works properly, right? That's pretty much the definition of something that most web developers couldn't care less about, and that people who do (for lack of a better term) "fast computing" care desperately about.<p>To give a recent example, what if you'd like to start serving Opus audio to all your users? The standard response to that idea now is "that's funny, Internet Explorer will never even support <i>Vorbis</i>, and that's over a decade old." If safe native code execution was a standard part of the browser right now, it would be trivial to distribute an Opus decoder alongside the "web app" you implemented in Javascript. Opus would just be your competitive advantage, not something you need to beg people to implement. It would already be ubiquitous.<p>Before anyone mentions X implementation of Y audio codec in Javascript in an attempt to discredit the value of native code execution, just stop. I highly doubt it will work acceptably on my mom's computer (the average computer that accesses your site is almost surely a hell of a lot less powerful than you may assume it is), and I highly doubt you'll ever be able to rival the performance of native code for processing on the order of video codecs anyways. Not to mention the fact that the majority of the nontrivial Javascript audio demos you've heard were made possible in no small part due to standardized, native code linear filtering and convolution.<p>"Frustration" would be the word that sums up the whole "web app" movement to me. When I see that someone's made a client-side GIF animating "web app," all I can think about is how it would have taken two seconds to hook an existing highly performant C GIF encoder up to some Javascript, and instead we had to wait for someone who knows Javascript to hack a painfully slow (and therefore useless for the vast majority of users) alternative together. You know how ubiquitous similar server-side services are? That's because all it takes to make one is a simple Javascript/HTML form (or HTTP, if you want to get trivial)-based interface to an existing C program. Just think of where client side web apps could be right now if the same were true for them.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_4631050 href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4631050&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%30%30%35%37"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_4631050></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=chipsy">chipsy</a> 231 days ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4631050">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I've been doing audio processing in Flash for a while (most recently, sample-based synthesis implementing a decent portion of SFZ and SF2, with 64-voice polyphony and filters) and I did have to push an unusual degree of effort into optimizing the sample copying code, with a Haxe macro that generates an optimal inlined loop for each combination of parameters. It can still use up most of a core when maxed out...<p>...however, I did some math and some extrapolation and determined that within the next three to five years this domain will be completely reasonable to approach from JS, driven by a combination of technologies:<p>-access to GPGPU from the browser. DSP work can generally be defined in terms of a shader, although it's still a very poorly understood area.<p>-more general-purpose cores, faster JIT performance, and possibly single-threaded hardware improvements as well. These things compound easily, so we could end up with a 50-100x larger JS performance envelope for this domain without even considering the GPU.<p>-maturation of the existing and planned audio APIs for common tasks. As you point out, this isn't interesting from a "ground-breaking tech" perspective, but in covering typical application needs, it's as important as the others since it's both convenient and optimized out of the box.<p>-maturation of cross-compilation technologies, smoothing over the "code has already been written" issue.<p>In a lot of ways, all JS has to do to be competitive is the "catch-up" work. It takes quite a while in tech time, but in human time, most of us will be around in the next decade.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_4631006 href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4631006&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%30%30%35%37"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_4631006></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jorangreef">jorangreef</a> 231 days ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4631006">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Yes, my comment was concerning the top-down approach taken by browser vendors, and that web apps need to be empowered with low-level APIs such as TCP and POSIX. I don't think I said or TBL said that we need to ship native code to browsers to do this. We don't. We don't need another language. Javascript is fine. We do need better low-level APIs. We do need to get away from relying on browser vendors to spec and implement everything correctly, because with such a massive surface like they're targeting they won't. We do need to push this responsibility out to the edges. We need to drastically reduce the standard API and move the functionality from high level (as in IndexedDB) to low level (as in POSIX). We need a strong powerful stable small core and OSS must do the rest. That's the general idea. The finer details can be nitpicked and that won't invalidate the general idea.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>A lot of people say they want a bytecode for the web. The problem is, bytecode vs text is just an encoding issue, and it's practically insignificant. It's a platform either way, and the real issues are what services the platform will provide.<p>For example, NaCl doesn't provide Garbage Collection (GC) last I checked. Applications can link in GC libraries for themselves, however that's more code for clients to download, and it may mean that the GC can't do all the low-level things that modern GCs do to get good performance. Is this an acceptable tradeoff for the web? I believe questions like this one are the important ones.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_4631727 href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4631727&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%30%30%35%37"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_4631727></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=MatthewPhillips">MatthewPhillips</a> 231 days ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4631727">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Languages targeting bytcode platforms are just as liable to be second-class citizens as ones targeting JavaScript.<p>Scala and Clojure don't support proper tail calls. Why? Because the JVM is the <i>Java</i> Virtual Machine! I believe there were similar issue for dynamic languages on the JVM for the longest time as well.<p>And now just imagine implementing a Haskell-&#62;JVM compiler. I wouldn't be surprised if that's actually <i>more</i> difficult than implementing a Haskell-&#62;JavaScript compiler.<p>So yes: with JavaScript as the target, other languages are second-class citizens. But with some bytecode, that won't probably won't change much. Knowing how these things get designed, the end result could easily be that <i>every</i> language including JavaScript becomes a second-class citizen.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_4631157 href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=4631157&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%36%33%30%30%35%37"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_4631157></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=bgarbiak">bgarbiak</a> 231 days ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4631157">link</a></span></div><br>
