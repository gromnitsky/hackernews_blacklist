* Overview

When user visits HN page, in omnibar appears an icon, which displays how
many links were filtered.

User sets black lists in options page.

| BL Type    | Match Modes |        |
|            |             |        |
|            | Exact       | Regexp |
|------------+-------------+--------|
| Domain     | *           |        |
| Link title |             | *      |
| User name  | *           |        |

Every BL is a (big) string where entries are separated by newlines.

Visually filtering is done by replacing a 'tr' element with a [+] link
which expands previously saved content of 'tr' element.
